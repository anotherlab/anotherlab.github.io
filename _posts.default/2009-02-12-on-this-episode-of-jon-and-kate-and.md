On this episode of “[Jon and Kate and](http://tlc.discovery.com/tv/jon-and-kate/jon-and-kate.html) [an American Chopper](http://turbo.discovery.com/american-chopper/american-chopper.html)”, [Kate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_And_Kate_Plus_8) and [Paul Sr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Teutul,_Sr.) have it out over how dirty the [OCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County_Choppers) office appears to be.  Jon struggles to find his place at OCC.  [Paulie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Teutul,_Jr.) nearly loses his mind when he takes the girls shopping for new shows.  [Mikey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Teutul) and [Aaden](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2767892/) continue to work on their concept bike.

Paul Sr organizes a dodge ball match between the OCC camera crew and the Gosselin camera crew.  Hilarity ensues when Kate shows off her new tattoo and Jon tells her “That’s not the Korean word for love&#8221;, but it’s kind of similar.”
