If you were looking for a reason to dump [DAAB](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/daab.asp "Data Access Application Block"), it looks like the good parts have already been folded into ADO.NET 2.0.

> The ADO.NET data providers in .NET 2.0 provide factory and common ADO.NET classes that make it easy to keep your code independent from a particular ADO.NET data provider or database product.
