As usual, Steve Tibbets hits the nail directly on the head with his post about [link rot and Wikipedia](http://blog.stevex.net/index.php/2008/03/17/linking-policy-and-wikipedia/).  I would have to say that the domain that I link to the most would have to be Wikipedia.  Most of the time I dot it because it&#8217;s convenient, but [link rot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot "Link rot is the process by which links on a website gradually become irrelevant or broken as time goes on, because websites that they link to disappear, change their content or redirect to new locations.") (there!  I just did it) happens a lot.  

Microsoft is pretty bad at this.  There have been too many times where I tried to follow a link into the MSDN, only to find that the MSDN has been reorganized and all of the links have changed.

If I link to another blog, I look for the [permalink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink "A permalink is a URL that points to a specific blog or forum entry after it has passed from the front page to the archives.").  That usually indicates that the link will be around for a while.  I also try to find links on multiple domains.  That way, the odds are less likely that [you](http://www.imageclub.com/404 "Screeching halt") [will](http://www.hhgttgonline.com/html/404.html "Don't Panic") [get](http://www.skinfusionz.com/404.htm "Fight Club") [the](http://adactio.com/404.php "D&D") [dreaded](http://www.akronnewsnow.com/404.htm "NO ONE EXPECTS The Dreaded 404!!!") [404](http://www.clubkayak.com/missing.html "Gilligan's 404") [page](http://www.hartnup.net/404 "Sheep") [when](http://www.2020hindsight.org/iuywoeifylkh "20/20 Highsight") [you](http://www.nivar.com/error404.html "Nelson") [follow](http://www.thoughtpolice.com/notfound.html "Big Brother") [a](http://www.4bitterguys.com/error_docs/not_found.html) [link](http://www.electric-manga.com/schplergle "Scientology") [that](http://hipbase.com/error/404.html "Office Space") [has](http://insubordinate.net/404.html "Guru") [rotted](http://www.helluva.co.uk/404page.htm) [away](http://www.geocities.com/thegreatchibi/404.html?1011649130080 "A Shrubbery!").

Steve posting his rules for linking and they just make sense:

  * If what I’m linking to has a top-level domain, then I will link to it.
  * If I’m linking to someone’s words (say, a blog post or magazine article), then I will link to that.
  * Otherwise, I’m linking to Wikipedia.
