**&#8220;What&#8217;s a PodGuide?.**  
A PodGuide is a very simple thing. It&#8217;s the combination of a map (PDF) of a certain place and a series of audio tracks (mp3) which you can download for your iPod. Think of an audio tour in a museum, but not limited to just that. You could have a PodGuide about the 10 coolest pubs in London for example, or a PodGuide which shows you the most known historic buildings in Bruges.&#8221;

I would love to see this take off for other cities. Even if you don&#8217;t have an iPod, you could burn a CD of the audio files and listen to it while driving to your destination. Instead of listening to the never ending chorus of &#8220;Are we there yet?&#8221;, you can learn about the places you are visiting.
