Here&#8217;s a [cool site](http://www.delphibasics.co.uk/index.html "Delphi Basics") that has a lot of reference information for Delphi.

> This web site provides help and reference for the fundamentals of the DelphiÂ© language. It is gives an introduction to the Delphi Object Oriented Language for newcomers, and provides a ready reference for experienced programmers.  
> It limits itself to a broad base of the language in order to keep things simple and manageable. The approach taken is to present the most useable basics of Delphi in as accessible a manner as possible.
