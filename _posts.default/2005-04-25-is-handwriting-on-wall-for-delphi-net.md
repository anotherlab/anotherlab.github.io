I just saw that Xavier Pacheco will [not](http://xavierpacheco.com/xlog/archive/2005/04/21/257.aspx) be writing a Delphi 2005 Developer&#8217;s Guide. His reasons were logical:

> First, I simply do not have the time to invest in writing about a product I do not use. While Delphi 7 is my tool of choice for writing Win32 applications, I use VS.NET and C# for developing .NET applications. Secondly, the current book&#8217;s sales have been very low. No publisher would take on this project as it would be a loss.

His Developer&#8217;s Guides for previous versions of Delphi are good books to have and I wonder is this part of trend. Borland has always been a niche player, but is their niche getting smaller?

I have Delphi 2005, and while I broke the shrink wrap to see what was inside, I have yet to install it. I use Delphi 5 & Delphi 7 for Win32 apps and they are my tools of choice for Win32. I&#8217;m also doing .NET programming and I&#8217;m using C# with VS.NET. I&#8217;ve been using Delphi since Delphi 2, but I can&#8217;t see any reason to use Delphi 2005 over VS.NET for .NET projects.
