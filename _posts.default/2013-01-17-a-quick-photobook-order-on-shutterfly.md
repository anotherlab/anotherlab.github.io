A $20 coupon code from [Shutterfly](http://www.shutterfly.com/) showed up in my inbox a week or so ago.  I could spend it any which I wanted on Shutterfly, that was pretty decent of them.  And of course I kept putting off using it.  Yesterday, I get another email telling me that I have one day left to use it.  
So I decided to do a picture book.  I went into [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) and selected about 150 or so pictures from the last 12 months and uploaded them to my Shutterfly account.  And then procrastinated until 10pm tonight.  It took abut 90 minutes, but I was able to make a family &#8220;year in review&#8221; book for 2012.  After placing the order, they  generated the code to display the book as a widget on this blog.  Which is what you see below.

  Shutterfly allowed me to customize my <a href="http://www.shutterfly.com/photo-books/custom-path">photo book</a> just the way I wanted.

I like using Shutterfly.  It&#8217;s one of those services that just plain works and I can upload my photos directly from Picasa without having to think about it.
