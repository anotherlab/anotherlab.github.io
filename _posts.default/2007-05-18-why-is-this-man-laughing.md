There’s a story behind that picture and it’s pretty much what you would think it is. 

> Dave Anthony toasts his achievement after driving his truck on top of a Kent house he was demolishing. Anthony said &#8220;it was a hell of a way to kick off the Memorial Day weekend.&#8221;

Somehow, it&#8217;s not too surprising that alcohol was involved.  The full story can be read [here](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/truk27.shtml).   I wonder how close he came to being a candidate for a [Darwin Award](http://www.darwinawards.com/ "The Darwin Awards")?  At the very least, he should get an [&#8220;Honorable Mention&#8221;](http://darwinawards.com/stupid/) for this stunt. 

It gets better with the [followup story](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/truk01.shtml):  Driving your pickup truck onto the roof of a house and getting your picture in the newspaper doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense when police want to talk to you about a $2,800 set of tires purchased with a stolen credit card.
