Here&#8217;s great example of how to use the Decorator pattern in C#&#8230;.

> The [Decorator](http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternDecorator.aspx) pattern is a means to transparently add responsibilities to another object on the fly.  In some cases it&#8217;s a simpler solution than creating additional subclasses through inheritance.  A decorator is implemented by creating a class that wraps access to another class.  The decorator implements the exact same public interface as it&#8217;s inner member.  That sounds like a lot of gobbledy-gook to me too, so let&#8217;s jump into a code sample.
