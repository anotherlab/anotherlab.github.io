I've been on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) for a while now. I still have my account on the dead bird site, but I haven't posted to it in ages. Not since Musk decided to burn billions of dollars. I never announced that I had quit that site, I just stopped using it. There are few technical sites that are there, so I kept my account active so that I could view their posts.

I try to use the same handle on social media sites and Bluesky is no exception.  I'm using the default domain, so you can find me at [anotherlab.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/anotherlab.bsky.social).

By the way, if you want to read a great book on how to wreck a company, I highly reccomend ["Character Limit"](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/737290/character-limit-by-kate-conger-and-ryan-mac/). It's written by [Kate Conger](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5siz7r23475fek2mj6p5zhzw) and [Ryan Mac](https://bsky.app/profile/rmac.bsky.social). It's an inside look of when Musk acquired Twitter.
