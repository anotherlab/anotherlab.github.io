The answer is not [this](http://www.moonrise.org/other/favorite.shtml).  These are the previously announced features of Microsoft Vista that have been dropped out of the product over the last couple of years.  Here’s a link to a [good article](http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/breakingnews.jhtml?articleId=189601760&cid=CRNBreakingNews) with the gory details…

At the rate features are being being axed, at what point does Vista come XP SP3? It’s becoming XP with tighter DRM, and who wants more of that?  Of all of the stuff that’s been yanked, WinFS was the one that I really wanted.  I really hoped that MS could have pulled it off.

On the other hand, it just sounded too complicated to actaully pull off.  Having your file system be dependant on SQL Server requires a lot more under the hood with that much more resources required.  To a certain extent, the desktop search tools that came out in the last two years made the need for WinFS less important.
