Testing an ASP.NET application on an XP box can be a royal pain in the ass sometimes (Ok, most of the time). It&#8217;s version of IIS is the [idiot brother](http://www.gasolinealleyantiques.com/kits/images/CarRevell/revell-billycarter.JPG) of the IIS that comes with Windows Server. It only supports a single site. That&#8217;s kind of annoying, but doesn&#8217;t impact the stuff that I work on. The true joy of XP&#8217;s IIS is the limit of 10 concurrent connections. I&#8217;ve hit that wall before. The [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000329.html) has some tips on how to bypass that limitation
