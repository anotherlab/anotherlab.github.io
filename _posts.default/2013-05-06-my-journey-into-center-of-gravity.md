Last Friday I was given a tour of the Center of Gravity (COG).  What exactly (and where exactly) is the Center of Gravity?  It’s full name is the [Tech Valley Center of Gravity](http://techvalleycenterofgravity.com/) and it is a community of technical and artistic creators, makers if you will.  They have a permanent [makerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) in downtown Troy, NY and their [grand opening is today](http://techvalleycenterofgravity.com/node/475).

I was lucky enough to get a tour on Friday from one of directors of board at COG, [Laban Coblentz](http://anotherlab.rajapet.net/www.linkedin.com/pub/laban-coblentz/10/820/285).  While their location is new, they have managed to collect a fair of equipment already. There is a lot equipment that can be used now.  From old time drill presses to laser cutters, from soldering stations to a bio lab. They are off to a good start.

You can [sign up](http://techvalleycenterofgravity.com/node/318) for free as an associate member, that will get you a membership card and the opportunity to purchase day passes to access the equipment in their makerspace.  If you plan on doing a lot of building and tinkering, then you’ll want to step up a full membership at $60/month) or “Super User” at $100/month.  The paid membership gives you full access to the makerspace and includes safety training.

If you need to fabricate some one off parts for a project, they have a couple of 3D printers.  In a couple of years, you’ll be able to buy one a Walmart, but right now it’s hard to get access to one around here.  When I did my robotics project last fall, I could have used a 3D printer to make the mounting pieces.
