This is old news, but still worth mentioning.  Ed Dague&#8217;s blog has moved from [Blogspot](http://middleofthings.blogspot.com/ "In Medias Res") to a [new location](http://blogs.timesunion.com/eddague/ "In Medias Res with Ed Dague") hosted by the Albany Times Union.  If you want to learn how local news stations work, his blog is required reading.
