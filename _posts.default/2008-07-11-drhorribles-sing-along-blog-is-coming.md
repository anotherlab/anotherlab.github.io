I can&#8217;t pass this one up.  [“Dr Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog”](http://www.drhorrible.com/ "Dr. Horrible") is a direct to the Internet miniseries from the mind of Joss Whedon.  It stars Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion and NPH has a knack for [playing crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7bK3w9Mw6w).

Act One will start streaming on July 15th.  Act’s Two and Three will follow on July 17th and July 19th, respectively.  After the 19th, they will be take down, but they will be available for purchase at a later date/

Here’s a teaser:
