This looks cool, a [&#8220;WSE tracing tool](http://mtaulty.com/blog/archive/2004/05/25/433.aspx "WSE tracing tool") written in WSE. I&#8217;m not sure if I would ever use it, I like using [Etheral](http://www.ethereal.com/) because it&#8217;s not limited to SOAP or WSE. I would like to see the [source code](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=f9ca52fa-0de6-48ab-a734-117761ac883f) to see how it was implemented.
