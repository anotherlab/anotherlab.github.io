> One of my favorite things to do when I worked on Star Trek was walk through the sets when nobody else was around, just so I could study the graphics. I&#8217;m sure you know about the giant Enterprise schematic in Engineering, but for the one person who doesn&#8217;t: The huge cutaway view of the Enterprise is filled with little graphical inside jokes, like a hamster wheel where the engine should be, only two restrooms at opposite ends of the ship, NOMAD from the original series, and a few other things that we all figured nobody would ever get close enough to see . . . until one director (I think it may have been Paul Lynch, who liked to yell &#8220;Energy! Energy! Energy! Energy! And! And! And! And! And! ACTION!&#8221; at the beginning of each take) wanted to do a shot that started close on the cutaway, swept across it, and pulled back into a two shot of me and Brent. When he watched the rehearsal, and saw that there was a giant duck decoy and a &#8220;Speed Limit&#8221; sign in the middle of his shot, he was pissed. I&#8217;m sure the art department felt bad about that, but we all had a god laugh while they reblocked the shot.
