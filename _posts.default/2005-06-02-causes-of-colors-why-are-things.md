[Causes of Colors &#8211; Why are things colored?](http://webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/index.html)

Everything you ever wanted to know about color. I found the bits about color blindness to be very interesting. When we design programs and web pages, we always have someone with severe red/green color blindness use the program to make sure it&#8217;s readable to him.

There are a couple of web sites that allow you to upload images and view them as they would appear to someone with color blindness. Try this [one](http://www.vischeck.com/daltonize/runDaltonize.php) and that [one](http://aspnetresources.com/tools/colorblindness.aspx).

When I was growing up, one of my friends that lived down the [street](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=42.868774,-73.791053&spn=0.008148,0.012972&z=1&hl=en) had red/green color blindness. He would come out to the bus stop wearing strange color combinations. We would send him back in to pick other clothes. I assume that these days, his wife gets that task.
