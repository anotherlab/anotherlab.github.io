[Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000449.html "The Coding Horror") posted [a cool article](http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/3S/font.htm "A Comparison of Popular Online Fonts: Which is Best and When? ") from Wichita State about font legibility. Serif mono-spaced fonts were the worst (sorry Courier) and Tahoma did the best.

The study is worth reading, the testing methodology was objective and at pretty much validates what fonts you think should be used for a given type of web site. The other good tip in Jeff&#8217;s post was that [Software Usability Research Laboratory (SURL) at Wichita State](http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/) has an excellent [newsletter](http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/newsletter.htm "Usability News is a newsletter highlighting some the Software Usability Research Laboratory's  (SURL) latest research findings.") that documents their usability studies.
