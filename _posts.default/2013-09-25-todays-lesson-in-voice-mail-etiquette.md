I just had a fun adventure in returning a wrong number voice mail. I arrived into work late today and I had a voice mail message time stamped at 10:00am. The message was the following:

> This is Steve F_\_\\_\_, number 1163. I need to know what time to come in for the \_\___ meeting. Please call me right back at XXX-XXXX

I have no idea who Steve is and we don&#8217;t number our clients, we go by their school district name. We also don&#8217;t any \____ meetings.

However Tyler is a big enough company to have another Chris Miller. That Chris works for another division a few time zones away. He was hired a few months back and we get emails and meeting invites for each other all the time. I make sure that any communication meant for the Chris Miller is sent to intended destination.

So I went under the assumption that this call may have been for the other Chris Miller. Steve didn&#8217;t say who he worked for, or where he was calling from, or even the area code. Our voice mail system lets you dial the caller back, so I did that.

When Steve answered, the conversation went more or less like this:

> <span><b>Steve: </b></span><span>Hello?</span>  
> <span><b>Me: </b>Hi, is this Steve F____?  This is Chris Miller from Tyler Technologies, and I am returning your call from 10:00 this morning</span>  
> <span><b>Steve: </b></span><span>Who is this?  I didn&#8217;t call you</span>  
> <span><b>Me: </b>You left a voice mail asking me to call XXX-XXXX</span>  
> <span><b>Steve:</b> </span><span>I called someone else at ZZZ-ZZZZ</span>  
> <span><b>Me:</b> That is my number (and I repeated his message back to him)</span>  
> <span><b>Steve:</b> </span><span>I was calling ____ at the ____ company, they must have given me the wrong number.</span>

Then we ended the call. If you call my number and get dumped to voice mail, you get the following message:

> Hi, you have reached Chris Miller at Tyler Techologies. I&#8217;m sorry I am not able to take your call right now, but if you leave your name and phone number, I&#8217;ll return your call&#8230;

If you are going to leave a message, please listen to the outgoing message to make sure that you have called the right person and/or company. Also, you need to leave your area code. We have customers across the country and in Canada, I do need your area code if you want me to call back.
