[HOW TO: Download, Install, and Remove the IIS MetaEdit 2.2 Utility](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q232068)

Here&#8217;s a tool that I ended up using quite a bit on the last project. MetaEdit is an IIS Metabase editor that looks and feels like the Registry Editor. It allows you to look at and edit the [IIS Metabase](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/iissdk/html/1e030be8-2659-4d09-bb45-79ee7d2073d4.asp?frame=true). 

While developing install projects with the Wise for Windows Installer 6.0, I saw that IIS virtual directories created by were not working correctly. I was able to view the virtual directory definition with MetaEdit to see that Wise had done wrong.
