[Alien Loves Predator](http://alienlovespredator.com/index.php) by Bernie Hou just kills me. It takes a sureal pup to take two of cinema&#8217;s biggest Sci-Fi villians and and have them share a NYC appartment like Felix and Oscar. After 100+ episodes, it&#8217;s still funny. The most amazing part is that 20th Fox didn&#8217;t sue Hou into the ground, someone there must get it. Check it out.
