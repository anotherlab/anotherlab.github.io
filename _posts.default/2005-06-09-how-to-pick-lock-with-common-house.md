I came across an [article](http://www.sorgonet.com/security/hdlockpicking/) on how to make a lock picker by hacking a hard drive and a mouse. [MacGyver](http://www.rusted-crush.com/macgyver/lessons.html) would be proud. As available in [Spanish](http://www.sorgonet.com/security/hdlockpicking/index_es.php)!
