It was only a matter of time before one of the [candidates](http://www.mikehuckabee.com/) played the [Chuck Norris card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_Facts).

 </p> 

What&#8217;s next?  [LOLCats](http://lolcat.com/) for [Kucinich](http://www.dennis4president.com/home/)?  Oh wait, that one [already happened](http://www.lolpresidents.com/president.pl?id=47).

Once you get past the wry amusement of the Chuck Norris &#8220;facts&#8221;, does the apparent endorsement of Norris add anything to Mike Huckabees quest for the White House?
