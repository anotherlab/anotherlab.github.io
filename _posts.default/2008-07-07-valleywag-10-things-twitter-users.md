I got a laugh from Valleywag’s article: [10 things Twitter users should not do](http://valleywag.com/387197/10-things-twitter-users-should-not-do "Silicon Valley Users Guide: 10 things Twitter users should not do").  My favorite quote was “Twitter is a heat sink for the unexpressed ego.”  If you are on Twitter and don’t find that line amusing, then it applies to you.  It’s like what [Ricky Gervais](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais) said about the American version of his [David Brent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brent) character, [“If you don’t know a Michael Scott, then you are a Michael Scott”](http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/47048/)
