Google yourself before applying for a job. Because we will. If you have posted sketchy stuff on social media and it’s publicly accessible, we will look at it. We value the ability to work in a group setting as important as having the technical skills.

I’m not in HR, but I’m one of the developers that will sit on on developer job interviews and I’ll look to see what sort of presence you had online. I don’t care about a “woo hoo, party!” post on Facebook, but other stuff is fair game. I have been amazed what people will leave out there, for the world to see.

We had one person apply (years ago) that had an extreme pornography manifesto on his personal web site. Extreme, as in he believed that it was OK to watch hard core pornography at work. I don’t care what you do on your own time., but no.

Another candidate had used Twitter to derogatory comments about his current employer and co-workers while he was still employed there. During his first week there. So many red flags, where do I start. First of all, why slag where you work? How would you even know anything on your first week? Did you not think that your co-workers would see this? Did you not think that future employers would see this? This indicates poor decision making skills.

Another candidate turned out to be troll on Reddit. Just loved to start arguments with other people and was very condescending.

The Internet is a great place to interact with people with opposing viewpoints. There is a big difference between going back and forth with someone else to prove or disprove a point, and being a jerk. We debate a lot of ideas at work and you need to be able to that in a civil manner.

Twitter is probably one of the best things that happened on the Internet. It is also probably one of the worst things available on the Internet. If your behavior has been questionable on Twitter, that’s another red flag. If you are denigrate another person because they are the other political party/candidate/elected official, that’s a problem. Your co-worker may share your political views or be a different side. You need to be able to work effectively either way.
