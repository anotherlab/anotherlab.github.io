I have a new course on Pluralsight, ["Xamarin.Forms 5 Fundamentals"](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/xamarin-forms-5-fundamentals.). It's seven hours of tutorials and demos for the developer new to Xamarin.Forms.

From my own product blurb:
> You will learn how to set up a Xamarin.Forms development environment and get started building apps. First, you will gain the knowledge of the basic structure. Next, you will understand how to use data binding to wire the data to the UI. Finally, you will know how to customize the UI with styling and theming. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of the Xamarin.Forms framework to get started building cross-platform, native mobile applications.

If you need to learn about how to use MVVM, Maps, localization, styling, etc; please check the course.

If you are doing Maui, a lot of this will still be applicable. The parts that are different, well, stay tuned.
