Markdown Monster

Markdown Monster is a Windows app editing Markdown files. Editing Markdown isn’t hard, in fact that is it’s raison etre. But Markdown Monster makes it really easy and you get a nice WYSIWYG preview as you type. There are so many guides and cheatsheets for Markdown, but it’s handy to not have to think about it. It’s not free, but if you edit a lot of .md files, take a look at it. https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/
