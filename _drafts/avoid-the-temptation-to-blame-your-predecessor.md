There seems to be a long standing tradition in blaming the **Person Who Left** for what ever problem you may be facing with your technology. We’ve all done it at one or point or another. It’s easy, they’re gone so they can’t defend themselves, it may be actually be accurate. Just don’t do it. You could end up being interviewed by the **Person Who Left**.

A while back, I got the chance to interview someone who had been roughly my replacement at a previous job. As soon as I saw his resume, I could tell that was the case. The guy, let’s call him “John”, had no idea who I was. His current boss (my old boss) didn’t tell him much, if anything, about me. Which is fair, I had only been there 10 years. I had learned a lot from my former boss, but he tended to treat his developers as peons (a reason why I left). Devs who left the company no longer existed to him.

“John” was going to be pretty much a non-starter for us. His skills covered many years, but not with stuff that we were looking for. The other devs were not comfortable with him. It was just one of those things, where someone just rubbed you the wrong way. It happens, everyone involved moves on.

At the time, I didn’t know how the other team members felt and we did a tech interview. When we interview someone, anything on the resume is fair game. I started asking him about one of the projects, I project that I had initially created. Except “John” didn’t know that. So I asked a few questions about the project. He took almost all credit for developing it (it was a mature product when I left) and he said he had to fix the bad design of the previous developer.

I don’t an ego about my code, I’ve written a lot of bad stuff over the years. I’ve also written some good code over the years. This particular product skewed closer to the good code. It was a Windows desktop app that was a port of a mature DOS application (this goes back more than a few years). The logic of the app was sound, but I’ll accept criticism on the Windows UI part. In fact, the UI was pretty bad, but it got the job done. I dived in deep on this application. It should have been obvious to “John” that I knew more than the average bear about this app, but he didn’t seem to pick up on.

“John” couldn’t explain the architecture of the app, or even it’s actual purpose. That was odd. In most interviews no one would have caught that. As the original developer, I did. I didn’t tell him that I was the original code monkey, but I didn’t hide it either. I asked questions about the tech stack around the app and it became obvious to me, that he didn’t know that app other than to make some minor changes. Which is fine, but be honest about your contribution.

Personality-wise, he didn’t mesh with the rest of our team, and we value that more than actual experience. My boss knew that “John” worked at my former employer. After the interview was over, I was candid. He couldn’t explain what the app did or how it worked. He had been there a couple of years, more than enough time to know what the product did. That was a red flag for me.
