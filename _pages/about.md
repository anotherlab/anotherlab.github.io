I am a <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Chris%20Miller-5000200" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP</a>, a Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer for iOS and Android, and the leader of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TechValleyNETUserGroup/" target="_blank">Tech Valley .NET User Group</a>.

I have been developing on various platforms for way too long to detail, but I currently work and write about C# programming using Microsoft and Xamarin/.NET MAUI tools. I work for Tyler Technologies, in the school transportation market. We are <a href="https://www.tylertech.com/careers" target="_blank">always hiring</a>, drop me a note if you have any questions. Twitter works best for that sort of thing.
