I was poking around the blogs posts on the [Falafel](http://www.falafel.com/) site and I came across a nice concise example by [John Waters](http://blog.falafel.com/UserView,user,John.aspx) of [how to define and use custom attributes in your own code](http://blog.falafel.com/2008/04/15/CustomAttributesToTheRescue.aspx).  His example shows how to use [custom attributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288454(VS.71).aspx) as a simple way to define tag values in sub classes without having to write the same code over and over again for each subclass.  It’s a short enough read that there’s no point in excerpting any of it here.
