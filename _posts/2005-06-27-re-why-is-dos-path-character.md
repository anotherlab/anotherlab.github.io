> Many of the DOS utilities (except for command.com) were written by IBM, and they used the &#8220;/&#8221; character as the &#8220;switch&#8221; character for their utilities (the &#8220;switch&#8221; character is the character that&#8217;s used to distinguish command line switches &#8211; on *nix, it&#8217;s the &#8220;-&#8221; character, on most DEC operating systems (including VMS, the DECSystem-20 and DECSystem-10), it&#8217;s the &#8220;/&#8221; character&#8221; (note: I&#8217;m grey on whether the &#8220;/&#8221; character came from IBM or from Microsoft &#8211; several of the original MS-DOS developers were old-hand DEC-20 developers, so it&#8217;s possible that they carried it forward from their DEC background).
