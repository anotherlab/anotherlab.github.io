[15 things you can do with RSS (it was supposed to be 10, but I got carried away) &#8211; Tim Yang&#8217;s Geek Blog](http://timyang.com/comments.php?id=630_0_1_0_C)

This is cool article describing the many things you can do via RSS feeds. I like the idea of using [mailbucket.org](http://www.mailbucket.org/) to collect all of my new email into my RSS Reader. I need to add that one to my &#8220;To Do&#8221; list.
