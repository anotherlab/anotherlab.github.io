This looks cool. I usually keep a mini tripod in my camera bag, but the Pod may work in places where the mini tripod wouldn&#8217;t be stable

> One of the worst hassles about having a tripod is that you have to carry it around everywhere. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t have too much space in my messenger bag for a decent-sized tripod. The Pod, from the tripod experts at Bogen, aims to solve that by providing a simple and stable camera support without the use of a tripod. It looks like a tiny beanbag at first, but attach any camera or camcorder to its universal locking bolt, and you have an instant tripod replacement. It contains plastic beans, is Velcro-sealed, water-resistant, and has a non-slip base for additional stability when positioning the camera. And since it&#8217;s only 5 x 2 inches, I could probably slip it in my bag, no problem. Now I can finally take a non-blurry evening shot with my dinky little camera. They come in yellow, red, and blue, and currently sell for $21 each.
