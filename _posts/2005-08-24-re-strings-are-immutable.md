Sahil has a good post that explains why you should use StringBuilder to concatenate strings instead of just doing &#8220;string a&#8221; + &#8220;string b&#8221;

Dude in the above code, first the framework will declare memory for all 5 strings, and as you concatenate them, it will have to reallocate, and copy memory all over, and over, and over and over again until it gets the final &#8220;str&#8221;. This is why, you should use StringBuilder &#8211; because that is not an immutable object. It has the ability to reuse the same memory. </span></span>
