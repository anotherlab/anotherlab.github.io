The story of Sony&#8217;s rootkit continues to live on. After [Mark Russinovich](http://www.sysinternals.com/Blog/ "Mark's Blog") first documented his analysis of the rootkit installed by content protected Sony audio CD&#8217;s, just about everyone and their grandmother linked to Mark&#8217;s site. Oddly enough, CNN didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s another story. Mark has provided updates to the rootkit story and it continues [here](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/sonys-rootkit-first-4-internet.html "Sony's Rootkit: First 4 Internet Responds").

The latest addition to the story is still worth reading. The company that wrote the rootkit, [First 4 Internet](http://www.first4internet.com/), responded to Mark in a comment on his blog. They address his concerns item by item, and of course, obsfuscate the issues. Mark&#8217;s latest blog entry goes over First 4 Internet&#8217;s comments, blowing huge gaping holes on each of their points. When this finally blows over, the Sony/First 4 Internet saga will be a text example of how NOT to address a growing PR disaster.
