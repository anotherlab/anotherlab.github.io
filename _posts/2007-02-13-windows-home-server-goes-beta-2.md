Windows Home Server has reached Beta 2.  Foe those of your playing the home version of &#8220;Name That Beta&#8221;, Beta 2 means that Microsoft has is now soliciting external testers to try the new OS.

I&#8217;ve been running [FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org/) for a couple of weeks without incident, so naturally I decided to see if I wanted to take a perfectly good running NAS and replace it with an unstable beta. It does [some cool things](http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2007/02/08/home-computer-backup.aspx) that I don&#8217;t do with FreeNAS, so I decided to see [what was needed](http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2007/02/12/beta-2-is-go.aspx).  It needs a Pentium 4, 512 MB RAM, and two or more drives with at least 300 GB space.

That seems a bit steep for a head-less device.  I&#8217;m running FreeNAS on a box that is at least 5 years old.  A 1 ghz Celeron with 256 MB RAM.  I started with a couple of 20 GB drives (remember 5 years ago) and added a 250 GB drive.

FreeNAS is working just fine, I think I&#8217;ll leave it alone.
