I must have been [sleeping](http://www.porterfieldsfineart.com/josephholodook/images/ripvanwinkle72.jpg) under a [rock](http://www.crystalinks.com/ayersrock.html), but when did &#8220;[Upsert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsert)&#8221; become a word? It refers to the combination of insert and update statements for a [RDBMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDBMS). What it means is: add the row it does not exist, otherwise update the row using the [primary key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key).

It would be [cool](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cool&r=f) if SQL Server had this feature. There have been a few times where it would have been useful, mainly with batch operations. In those cases, I wrote stored procedures to handle upsert operations. At the server level, it should be [trivial](http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/trivial.html) to implement an upsert statement as opposed to manually coding it in SQL.

[It caught my eye](http://sqljunkies.com/WebLog/ashvinis/archive/2005/06/15/15829.aspx) when I read Ashvini Sharma&#8217;s [blog](http://sqljunkies.com/WebLog/ashvinis/default.aspx).
