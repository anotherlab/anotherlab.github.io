Thomas Friedman had an interesting column today. It&#8217;s titled [&#8220;China&#8217;a Little Green Book&#8221;](http://select.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/opinion/02friedman.html?n=Top%2FOpinion%2FEditorials%20and%20Op-Ed%2FOp-Ed%2FColumnists%2FThomas%20L%20Friedman "NY Times article, subscription required.") and he talks about how the growing conservation movement in China. China is poluted to a scale beyond anything we ever saw here. When we were over there in the summer of 2003, I was astounded by amount of smog in the air. It&#8217;s good to see that they are going to doing something about it.
