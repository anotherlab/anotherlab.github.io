title: Snap Preview Anywhere is annoying

Lately, I&#8217;ve been starting to see idiot popup windows on blogs that should know better.  The popups are from &#8220;Snap Preview Anywhere™&#8221;, a javascript thingie that displays a popup window when you move the mouse over a link on a page.

It sounds like a clever idea, but then again someone once thought the <BLINK> attribute was a clever idea.

I find the popups to be very annoying.  If you are trying to read something and you move the mouse over one these snap-enabled links, your experience has been disrupted.  I&#8217;m not the only one [who](http://performancing.com/node/5721 "Nick Wilson's blog") [dislikes](http://waldo.jaquith.org/blog/2007/01/snap-preview-disable/?cat=2) SPA.

The idea is to show a preview of the site behind the link so that you can tell if you want to click that link.  Come on people, it&#8217;s 2007 and our browsers have multiple tabs.  No mysterious force is preventing me from opening that link in a background tab.

The good news, it&#8217;s pretty easy to fix.  You can disable the popup by going [here](http://www.snap.com/about/spa_faq.php?disable_spa=1 "Disable Snap Preview Anywhere") and scroll down to the &#8220;Snap Preview Anywhere Activation&#8221; block and follow the instructions.  That method requires that your browser allow cookies.

If you are using FireFox, you can really take the snap out by installing [AdBlock Pro](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1865/) and adding snap.com to the list of blocked sites.  That works very nice.
