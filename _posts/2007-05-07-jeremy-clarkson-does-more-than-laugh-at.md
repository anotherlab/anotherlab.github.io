I really wish I could get [&#8220;Top Gear&#8221;](http://www.topgear.com/) here.  I can just watch that show for hours.  The only way I get to see any episodes is through YouTube.   I just came across this little gem:

 

<div>
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIf-0S48WM0"><img loading="lazy" height="90" src="https://i2.wp.com/img.youtube.com/vi/kIf-0S48WM0/2.jpg?resize=120%2C90" width="120" border="1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> </p> 
  
  <div>
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIf-0S48WM0">watch video</a>
  </div>

Where Jeremy Clarkson destroys the worst modified car on the planet. He does more than [laugh at rice](http://www.laughatrice.com/), he takes action.
