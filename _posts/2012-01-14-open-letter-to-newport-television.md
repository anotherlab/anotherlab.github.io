title: An open letter to Newport Television

This is a copy of an email that I just sent to [Newport Television](http://www.newporttv.com/default.aspx), owners of WXXA-FOX23

Please forward to [Michael DiPasquale](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-dipasquale/8/578/772), Vice-President/Asst. General Counsel at Newport Television 

Dear Mr. DiPasquale,

I am a Verizon FiOS subscriber in the Albany, NY area.  I have noticed that you have pulled [WXXA-FOX23](http://www.fox23news.com/) from Verizon FiOS TV because your carriage agreement expired on January 12, 2012.  My understanding of this is that your company, [Newport Television, and Verizon could not come to an agreement over the rates](http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/verizon-blacks-out-newport-tv-stations-over-retrans-impasse.html).

As someone who watches WXXA, I am one of your customers.  As such, I would like to share my opinion.  I don&#8217;t know the details of your carriage rate negotiations, but I think you should settle with Verizon.  

I don&#8217;t want to pay more for a channel that I can get over the air (OTA).  The FOX network programming that I watch is mostly available via the [FiOS Video On Demand (VOD) service](http://www22.verizon.com/residential/fiostv/vod/vod.htm).  I won&#8217;t get to see the show when it airs, but I&#8217;ll see it within a week.  And it will be commercial free.  I like my [DVR](http://www.tivo.com/), I watch TV on my schedule.  

With your channel being OTA only, the only time I&#8217;m going to watch it is going to be for sports. I liked watching the FOX23 news, that was one of the few shows you had my attention through commercials.  And that was the same for FOX sports.  I can put up with the annoyance of switching to the OTA signal for the sports, but for the rest of your coverage, I&#8217;ll just skip it.

FiOS coverage is still small in the Albany area, but the areas with FiOS availability tend to be the [higher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem,_New_York#Demographics) [income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonie,_New_York#Demographics) [areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotia,_New_York#Demographics).  We are the people that your advertisers want to reach.  You have better access to the subscriber numbers, but I would expect that you are no longer available in 10,000 household in middle to upper middle class neighborhoods in this area.  If I were an advertiser with you, I would be negotiating for a lower rate on commercial air time. 

I don&#8217;t know the detail of your negotiations with Verizon, but if you are asking for a higher rate, I really think that you should reconsider your terms.  I don&#8217;t know the state of the local economy is in Kansas City, MO; but it&#8217;s not that great here.  Please consider this during your negotiations with Verizon FiOS.

sincerely,  
Chris Miller  
Slingerlands, NY
