I finally got a spam comment. In fact, it was from another Blogger user. That&#8217;s in violation of the Blogger TOS, so forwarded his infomation to the Blogger people (Google). I gave Google about a week to take whatever action they wanted to take against that user and then I removed that comment. It was odd that way the spam appeared. I posted a new entry and within 2 minutes, it got a comment. This is by no means a high traffic site, it&#8217;s mainly to keep track of things.
