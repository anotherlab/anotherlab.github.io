[&#8220;In space, no one can hear you scream.&#8221;](http://www.posterwire.com/archives/2005/04/26/copywriter/)

Ever wonder about the origins of the taglines on a movie poster? The one that I always remember is &#8220;In space, no one can hear you scream.&#8221;, from the movie ALIEN.[](http://www.planetavp.com/amr/films/a1/a1.html). The link for this posting is to an interesting blog about movie posters.
