I just came across Ed Dague&#8217;s [blog](http://middleofthings.blogspot.com/index.html). He&#8217;s much more than a [floating head](http://www.foamtotem.org/foamtotm/edshead/index.html) on a an obscure web site. His comments on local media and politics are both interesting and intelligent. His [take](http://middleofthings.blogspot.com/2006/12/how-political-was-spitzers-motive.html) on Spitzer&#8217;s naming of Michael Balboni as Deputy Secretary for Public Safety shows how 2 out of the three 3 local stations completely missed the [hidden implications](http://www.urbanelephants.com/nyc/node/6038) of that move.

He had to retire too soon from local [TV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNYT) for [health reasons](http://www.hempevolution.org/media/troy_record/tr0411013.htm), but I&#8217;m glad to see that he has a forum for sharing his thoughts.
