Back in the [Amiga days](http://www.amiga.com/amigaos/ "1987-1993"), SteveX was a name every programmer knew from his [VirusX, ScreenX, PointerX applications](http://www.amiga-stuff.com/pd/snag.html "Amiga Stuff"). These days, he&#8217;s in the .NET world and has a cool link for [string formatting in C#](http://blog.stevex.net/index.php/string-formatting-in-csharp/ "string formatting in C#").
