[Scotsman.com News &#8211; Funniest jokes &#8211; The world&#8217;s funniest joke?](http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=70&id=1096842002)

This was deemed to be the world&#8217;s funniest joke:

&#8220;Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn’t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. 

&#8220;The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps: ‘My friend is dead! What can I do?’ The operator says: ‘Calm down, I can help. First, let’s make sure he’s dead.’ 

&#8220;There is a silence, then a shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says: ‘OK, now what?’&#8221;
