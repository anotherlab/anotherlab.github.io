Over the weekend, my Tivo suggested that I record the trailer for King Kong. Being easily persuaded by [cheeky](http://www.cheekymonkeytoys.com/info.html) gadgets, I let it record it. Come on, it&#8217;s got Jack Black in it. It looks like a period piece, a remake of the original version. It&#8217;s either going to be really good or really bad, I didn&#8217;t see any middle ground on this one. You can view it online [here](http://www.kingkongmovie.com/ef239524432ba87f1ca8f70eed4b1fa7/en_large.html) (QuickTime).
