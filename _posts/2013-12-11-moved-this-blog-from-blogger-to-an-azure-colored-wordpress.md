You may have noticed that this blog looks a little different.  I just migrated my blog from Google&#8217;s Blogger platform to a self-hosted [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) blog.  And it&#8217;s running in Microsoft&#8217;s [Azure](http://windowsazure.com) cloud.

Migrated nearly decade of posts, comments, permalinks, and hopefully most of the images.  After a few days of WordPress, I really wish I had done this years ago.  So much easier to maintain, from both the WordPress side and the Azure side of things.

I&#8217;m in the process of doing another post that explains how I did it.  Spoiler: it was a piece of cake.
