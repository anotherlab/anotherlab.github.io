There’s a flyer floating around in the office and it’s worth sharing the details with the rest of the world (the part of the world that lives near Latham, NY).  [Brooks Bar-B-Q](http://www.brooksbbq.com/) of Oneonta will be participating in a fund raiser for [The Coins Foundation](http://www.coinsfoundation.org/) on July 20, 2010.  They will be selling dinners to go, with the proceeds going to help build homes, schools, and hospitals in areas where they are needed the most.

This will be from 3:30 to 6:30pm and will be located at the [COINS building](http://www.coins-global.com/usa/h/Home/Company/1/) at 6 Airport Park Blvd, Latham NY 12110.  I ordered dinners for my family at last year’s fund raiser and the food is really good.</p>
