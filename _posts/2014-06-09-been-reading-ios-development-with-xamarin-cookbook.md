    iOS Development with Xamarin Cookbook
  </p>
</div>

A new [Xamarin iOS](http://xamarin.com/platform) book has just come out and if you&#8217;re programming for the iPhone on the Xamarin platform you will want it on your bookshelf.  It&#8217;s titled [&#8220;iOS Development with Xamarin Cookbook&#8221;](http://bit.ly/1tnxmGX "iOS Development with Xamarin Cookbook") and is written by [Xamarin MVP](http://xamarin.com/mvp) [Dimitris Tavlikos](https://twitter.com/dtavlikos).

This book will take you from the first steps in writing and compiling an iOS application with Xamarin to working with advanced topics like writing multi-touch gestures and working with iCloud.  The intended audience for this book are .NET developers new to iOS development and Objective-C developers who want to be able to use the Xamarin tools.

This is not a cross-platform guide.  While a few topics have corresponding features with Xamarin.Android, this is an iOS only book.  For example, chapter 12, &#8220;Multitasking&#8221;, covers the iOS specific APIs for running code in the background and how to respond to events raised by the background code.

The advantage of writing a guide for one platform is that Dimitris can go deep on specific features and APIs.  Each chapter has a set of &#8220;recipes&#8221; that explain how to do a task.  Each recipe is independent from the others.  You don&#8217;t have to build the first four recipes in a chapter in order to try out the code for the fifth.

Each recipe follows a pattern.

  1. **Recipe Name**: First Dimitris describes what the recipe will do
  2. **Getting Ready:**  What has to be done before the recipe code is written.
  3. **How to do it:**  A series of steps that describe the code to write
  4. **How it works:** An in-depth description of what that code does
  5. **There&#8217;s more:** Addition information about this feature
  6. **See Also:** A list of other recipes that are related to this one

For me, the book was worth it just for chapter 14, Deploying.  I don&#8217;t have to submit apps to App Store that often, it&#8217;s useful to have all of the steps required, all in one spot.
