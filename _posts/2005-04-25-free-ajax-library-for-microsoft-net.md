There looks like there is a freeware [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX) [library for .NET 1.1](http://weblogs.asp.net/mschwarz/archive/2005/04/14/400422.aspx). I know this stuff will be in ASP.NET 2.0, but that&#8217;s not out yet and this one is.

I think I&#8217;m going to play with this one a bit&#8230;.
