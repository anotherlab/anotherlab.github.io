From the The Hartford Courant:

> &#8230;A motorist on Powder Forest Drive Friday morning noticed what looked like a whole chicken — the kind bought at grocery stores for roasting — with a pipe bomb stuffed inside, police said Monday. 
> 
> When they arrived on the scene around 9 a.m. officers found the roaster had an improvised explosive device where the fowl&#8217;s innards should have been. 
> 
> They closed the road for part of the morning as the Hartford Police Department&#8217;s bomb squad was called to detonate the device, police said.
