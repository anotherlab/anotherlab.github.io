Filmmaker Duncan Jones has started a book club of his father&#8217;s 100 favorite books and has invited everyone to join.

The first book has already been selected, [_Hawksmoor_ by Peter Ackroyd](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67729.Hawksmoor)

_Hawksmoor_ is a 1985 novel that takes place in the 18th and 20th centuries. From Wikipedia: It tells the parallel stories of Nicholas Dyer, who builds seven churches in 18th-century London for which he needs human sacrifices, and Nicholas Hawksmoor, detective in the 1980s, who investigates murders committed in the same churches.

Bowie&#8217;s list of 100 books to read can be found [here](http://www.davidbowie.com/news/bowie-s-top-100-books-complete-list-52061). Some of these books may be harder to find than the others. I plan on seeing how many of them I can get through my local library. Also check out the [The Bowie Book Club](http://www.bowiebookclub.com/) and it&#8217;s accompanying [podcast](http://www.bowiebookclub.com/episodes/). They already have a decent start on the [Top 100](http://www.bowiebookclub.com/david-bowies-100-most-influential-books/).
