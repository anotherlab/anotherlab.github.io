**MooreIsLess**’s Law. Which, given Moore’s Law, holds that the time taken to boot a Microsoft Operating System is constant.

That [little gem](http://www.redlandsnursery.com.au/infonotes/littlegem.htm) comes from [&#8220;What do Grumpy Old Programmers believe?&#8221;](http://grumpyoldprogrammer.myblogsite.com/blog/_archives/2005/5/10/668751.html). I came across a reference to [Grumpy Old Programmer](http://grumpyoldprogrammer.myblogsite.com/blog) in Don Box&#8217;s [blog](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/) and it&#8217;s pretty funny. Lot&#8217;s of rants with more than just a kernal of truth in them.
