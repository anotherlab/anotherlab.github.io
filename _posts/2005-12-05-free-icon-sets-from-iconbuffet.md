Thanks to a [tip posted](http://forevergeek.com/news/iconbuffet_now_offers_free_icon_packs.php) on Forevergeek.com, I came across a site that offers free commercial quality icon sets.  [IconBuffet.com](http://www.iconbuffet.com/) sells a wide variety of icon sets for app and web work.  What they also offer are free sets.  You register with them and once a month they send you a free set of icons.  To raise it up a notch, they will send different people different sets each month.  You are allowed to send each set up to 5 times to other people through IconBuffet’s web site.  They call it “Free Delivery”.

I just signed up and I have the “Oslo Finance” set.  There are about 10 or 11 different images, in a wide variety of formats: BMP, GIF, Mac ICNS, Win ICO, TIFF, and PNG.

If anyone with an IconBuffet account wants this one, just leave a comment here or email me at anotherlab{at}gmail{dot}com.  I’m looking for the other sets, with my eye on the Shanghai Tech and Shanghai Tech Vector sets.

I just got my first deliveries (thanks Dan!).  It’s the Shanghai Tech Vector and Shanghai Tech sets.  Duncan sent me all 5, I now have a complete set.  I’m not sure what I’m going to do with them, but they are cool.
