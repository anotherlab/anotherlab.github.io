A 26 year old art student named Pablo Wendel joined the [Terra Cotta warriors](http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/shaanxi/xian/terra_cotta_army/index.htm) in Xi&#8217;an. His home made costume was so convincing it took a while for the security guards to find him.Â <a href="http://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif?w=680" alt="Posted by Picasa" align="middle" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
