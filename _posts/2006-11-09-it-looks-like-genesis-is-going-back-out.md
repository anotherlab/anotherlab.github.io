It looks like [Genesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(band)) is going back out on the road. [Phil](http://www.philcollins.co.uk/), [Mike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rutherford), and [Tony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Banks_(musician)) will be doing 20 shows in [Europe](http://www.genesis-music.com/genesisdates.htm) and 20 in the US for the &#8220;Turn It On Again&#8221; tour of 2007. Originally, the five members from the classic &#8217;70s lineup met to see if they could schedule a set of shows of [&#8220;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lamb_Lies_Down_on_Broadway), but [Peter Gabriel](http://www.petergabriel.com/) declined due to scheduling conflicts. With Peter out, it didn&#8217;t make sense to include [Steve Hackett](http://www.stevehackett.com/) as the four member version of Genesis was only a tiny slice out of their history. You can view their news conference where they discuss all of this from this shiny [link](http://www.genesis-music.com/).



With just 20 shows in the US, I don&#8217;t have my hopes up for a [local](http://www.pepsiarena.com/) [appearance](http://www.spac.org/).</p>
