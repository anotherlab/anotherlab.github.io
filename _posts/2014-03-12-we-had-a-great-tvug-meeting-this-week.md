A couple of nights ago, [@PeterLanoie](https://twitter.com/@peterlanoie) did a great presentation on [IIS](http://www.iis.net/) administration.  This was at the [March TVUG meeting](http://tvug.net/post/March-Meeting-IIS-Administration-Tricks-Tips-and-Pitfalls).  We had a good sized crowd and there were plenty of questions and discussions from the audience.  Peter had some cool tricks to show off.  Like how to use an [App_Offline.htm](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/09/442332.aspx) file to take a site offline while making updates.

We spent a lot of time going over session management, multiple levels of configuration files, deployments, and how to handle those types of thing when you have a web farm.  As developers, we don&#8217;t always have the experience or knowledge to optimize IIS for large traffic sites.

Peter spent over two hours drilling in deep on these topics.  It&#8217;s great when a user group member can step up to the plate and Peter knocked this one out of the park.
