I just did a simple hardware hack to my [HTC 8X](http://www.htc.com/www/smartphones/htc-wp-8x/) phone.  I have been having random problems where the phone loses it&#8217;s ability to make calls or to send SMS messages.  And it will do a spontaneous reboot every once in a while.  So I took the SIM card out and stuck some tape to the back of it and put it back in.

<img loading="lazy" style="float: left;" onmouseover="this.src='http://anotherlab.smugmug.com/photos/i-MV2XkcG/0/M/i-MV2XkcG-M.png';" alt="HTC 8X" src="https://i0.wp.com/anotherlab.smugmug.com/photos/i-MV2XkcG/0/Th/i-MV2XkcG-Th.png?resize=150%2C132" width="150" height="132" data-recalc-dims="1" /> These problems has been going on for months and a bunch of people have been complaining about it on the [Microsoft](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wptext-htc8x?sort=lastreplydate&dir=desc&tab=Threads&status=&mod=&modAge=&advFil=&postedAfter=&postedBefore=&threadType=All&tm=1393051071455) and [Verizon forums](https://community.verizonwireless.com/thread/793465).  Some people have been reporting that the problem goes away if you change the settings, but that doesn&#8217;t appear to be the fix.  I think there are two problems, one hardware related with the SIM card tray, the other one a firmware issue.

The firmware problem appears to be related to what [has been reported](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wptext/after-gdr2-on-verizon-htc-8x-intermittent-cant/3f521fa3-2fa3-463c-a175-52d3f00df6a0?page=4) as an issue with SMS traffic and with which switch the phone is connected to at the time.  When this happens, I have to put the phone in &#8220;Airplane Mode&#8221; and then back to normal.  Usually, I get SMS functionality again after doing so.    Until Verizon and HTC decide to fix this, there&#8217;s nothing else I can do about that.  Short of a miracle in the 8.1, I&#8217;m not expecting any fixes on that.

The other problem is that the SIM card appears to lose it&#8217;s connection with the phone.  When that happens I lose voice and SMS and sometimes the phone reboots.  That I can try to fix.  A few people have reported fewer SMS and reboot issues after padding the SIM card with tape.  A couple of pieces of tape are enough to keep the SIM card in tighter contact with the phone.  So I took the card out and applied some tape, as seen in the following photo:

You can see the edges of the tape past the edges of the card.  It&#8217;s actually a MicroSIM card and it fits in a little tray that goes into the side of the phone.  You don&#8217;t need much tape.  I used clear shipping tape, just two pieces were enough.  The SIM card tray went in with a snug fit.  Hopefully my ability to send SMS messages will be a little more reliable.  I like this phone, but being able to make calls and send text messages should be the more reliable part of a phone.
