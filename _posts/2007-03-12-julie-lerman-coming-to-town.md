On Tuesday, [Julie Lerman](http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog/) is coming in from Vermont to do a presentation about [ADO.NET Orcas](http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog/2007/01/20/GrokkingEntityMappingInADONETOrcas.aspx) at the [TVUG](http://www.tvug.net/) meeting.  This will be the first meeting held at our office, it should be a cool presentation.  I saw her speak last year at a TVUG meeting and she&#8217;s very good.
