I finally got around to booking my flights to the [MVP Summit](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/summit.aspx "MVP Global Summit") in November. Getting a rental car this time, one of my co-workers will be the same flight and we can skip the taxi/shuttle/uber rides and do possibly see a little more of Seattle this time around.
