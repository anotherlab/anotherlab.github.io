Samsung has a cell phone with a 8gb hard drive (form musinc playing) and they have banned it from their own premises. They don&#8217;t allow portable memory devices that can be used to smuggle out confidential information. Gizmode has the article [here](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/samsung-bans-schb570-from-internal-use-176410.php "Samsung Bans SCH-B570 From Internal Use"). It&#8217;s kind of funny, in an ironic sort of way. 

Update: Techdirt has a better article [here](http://techdirt.com/articles/20060526/0236259.shtml).
