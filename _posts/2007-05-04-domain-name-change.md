As of today, the address of this blog is now <http://anotherlab.rajapet.net/>.  The old name, [http://anotherlab.blogspot.com](http://anotherlab.blogspot.com/), still works but you&#8217;ll see the new name in your browser&#8217;s address field.   I made the change after signing up for Google Apps.  I wanted to have a personal email address with my own domain and [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/admins/editions_spe.html "Welcome to Google Apps") will do that for free.  I&#8217;ve had rajapet.net parked at [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/default.asp) for the last few years (for a side project that never got off the ground), I figured I might as well use it.

After going through the steps with my domain registrar to map my domain name to Google&#8217;s mail servers, it was then a trivial matter to add a [CNAME Record](http://help.godaddy.com/article.php?article_id=679&topic_id=163 "A CNAME is simply an alias for a host record") to rajapet.net have it point back to ghs.google.com.  Once I verified that the registration had been posted to that [series of tubes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtOoQFa5ug8 "DJ Ted Stevens Techno Remix: "A Series of Tubes""), I went in to the Blogger Admin page and assigned anotherlab.rajapet.net to the blog.

I signed up for Google Apps mainly for the vanity email address, but now that I have it, I want to use more of the features like the Calendar.

I&#8217;m using more and more of Google these days.  Their [Google Browser Sync](http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/) extension was the feature that made me switch from [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) to [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) for most of my web browsing needs.  I bounce back and forth between six machines between the office and home and I have the same bookmarks on each machine and Google takes care of it for me.  I have been an Opera fanboy for the last few years, it took a lot to make me switch.

My blog is run on Google (Blogger).  I have a [GMail](http://mail.google.com/) account and I use [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk) to interact with one of our remote contract programmers.  After playing around with a few desktop based RSS Readers, I switched to [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/view/).  I for one, welcome our new Google Overlords.
