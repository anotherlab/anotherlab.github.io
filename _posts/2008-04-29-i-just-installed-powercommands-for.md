I just installed the PowerCommands 1.1 for Visual Studio 2008.  This is a set of extensions to the VS 2008 IDE that provide some additional functionality.  The available commands are listed [here](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands "PowerCommands for Visual Studio 2008 - Home").  The Collapse Projects command sounds pretty basic, but it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always wanted and it&#8217;s great for large solutions.  

The best part of PowerCommands?  You get the source code, which would be handy if you ever want to write your own VS extension.
