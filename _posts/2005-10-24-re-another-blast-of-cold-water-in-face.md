Bill lists a couple of good references for doing the build the right way. I want these two books.

> Eric Garulay, one of the uber cool folks over at Addison-Wesley shot me a copy of [The Build Master Microsoft&#8217;s Software Configuration Management Best Practices](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321332059/qid=1130075716/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8567025-4007142?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) by [Vincent Maraia](http://blogs.msdn.com/vincem) ( [Build Master Web Site](http://www.buildmaster.com/) ) . Well, looks like Kim is going to appropriate the book from me so I need to hurry up and get it read, fortunately that&#8217;s not a problem because it&#8217;s pretty amazing.  Let me step back a second.  A while ago, my buddies at [http://www.apress.com](http://www.apress.com/) sent me a book titled [Expert .NET Delivery using NAnt and CruiseControl .NET](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590594851/qid=1130075951/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8567025-4007142?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)  and it was a real eye opener.  Until then, my build strategy was about as sophisticated as “Get Latest Version” from Visual Source Safe, flipping the Release bit and compiling.
