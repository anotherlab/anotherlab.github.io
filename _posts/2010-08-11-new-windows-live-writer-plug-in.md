title: New Windows Live Writer Plug-in Submission Process
date: 2010-08-11T02:50:00-05:00
---
I just received an email from Microsoft about changes to the submission and and hosting of Windows Live Writer plug-ins.  It goes into effect on September 10, 2010 (one month from now).  Live Writer is a great blogging tool and it has a nice API for extending it’s functionality.  If you use Live Writer, you should check out the plug-ins at [Windows Live Gallery](http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?pl=8). 

I submitted a SmugMug plug-in a couple of years ago.  It will need to be resubmitted.  Actually, I’ll probably rewrite it.  I’m sure it’s obsolete by now.  Here are the contents of the email.
