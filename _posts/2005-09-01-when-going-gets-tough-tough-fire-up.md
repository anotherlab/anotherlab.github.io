Just about everyone on the planet knows what Katrina did. And most of us know that New Orleans has been all but abandoned. But not everyone left. [DirectNIC](http://www.directnic.com/ "http://www.directnic.com/"), a web hosting company, is running from a dry and secure skyscraper in New Orlean&#8217;s central business district. They have enough backup power for a few weeks and it looks like they will need it. In addition to keep their customer&#8217;s web sites running, they have a [blog](http://www.livejournal.com/users/interdictor/ "The Interdictor") documenting what they are going through and what they are seeing from their vantage point. It&#8217;s required reading folks.

It&#8217;s a compelling drama. It&#8217;s very much like reading a [Hunter S. Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson "Hunter S. Thompson") story. You feel like civilization is coming apart at seams. I IM&#8217;ed the author of the blog. I really didn&#8217;t have anything to say him other than he rocks. They are living in a [twisted](http://www.hit-n-run.com/cgi/read_review.cgi?review=13383_gislef "In Sensurround!") [Charlton](http://www.theforbidden-zone.com/ "The Forbidden Zone") [Heston](http://www.scifimoviepage.com/omega.html "The Omega Man") [movie](http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/soylent-green.html "Soylent Green") and they are the good guys.

In addition to the blog, they have a live webcam feed at [mms://204.251.3.10:3349](mms://204.251.3.10:3349 "mms://204.251.3.10:3349") which is usually maxed out. There is also a mirror feed at [http://old.mises.org:88/NO2](http://old.mises.org:88/NO2 "http://old.mises.org:88/NO2"). Right now I&#8217;m looking a hand holding a clipboard with &#8220;Does Papa John&#8217;s deliver in New Orleans?&#8221; on it. Someone still has his sense of humor.

Tomorrow, I&#8217;m going to the Red Cross and donating blood. This is worse than 9/11, we all have to step up to the plate.
