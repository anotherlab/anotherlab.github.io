          After coming back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_farm" title="AKA cube farm">Cubeland</a> from lunch, I saw a small package on my chair. It had airmail stamps and came from Middlesex, England. I had no idea what it was, so I ripped it open to find Boland&#8217;s inflatable action figures. The images are courtesy of the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details/0,,82,00.html" title="Camera phones take sucky pictures">crapmatic instant picture device</a>. The top one is Delphi Man, lord of the cubicle. The lower picture is of Doctor Deadline, trusty companion of Delphi Man.</p>

            There are limited edition items, Borland only made 1000 of each one. So far they haven&#8217;t turned up on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/" title="A fool and his money are soon parted.">eBay</a>. Oddly enough, the website that advertised the super duo, <a href="http://www.delphisuperhero.com/">www.delphisuperhero.com</a> has been replaced with the Delphi 2006 web site. In addtion to registering to win the inflatable characters, there were PDF files that you could download and print your own.</td> </tr>
