I came across an interesting [blog posting](http://aspnetresources.com/blog/prototype_vs_atlas.aspx "Prototype vs. Atlas") about the [Prototype](http://prototype.conio.net/) Javascript package and how it compares with [Atlas](http://atlas.asp.net/quickstart/). It boils down to they try to do similiar things, but come from different directions. Atlas is server-side centric and is designed to bolt into Visual Studio and Prototype is client-side oriented and isn&#8217;t a .NET tool (100% Javascript). Check out the links to [moo.fx](http://moofx.mad4milk.net/) and [Rico](http://openrico.org/rico/home.page) in that article, they are doing some cool UI things with Prototype.
