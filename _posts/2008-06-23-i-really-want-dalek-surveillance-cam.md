I saw [this](http://www.channelflip.com/2008/06/23/dalek-security-camera/ "tech: Dalek Security Camera") linked to on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/23/dalek-toy-turned-int.html), a remote control [Dalek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) toy outfitted with a pinhole security camera with wireless transmitter. It will transmit decent quality video up to 100m.

It’s not cheap, but the really cool toys never are.
