As one of the duties that come with being the computer geek in the family, I get asked to check out the pc&#8217;s of friends and family. I usually bring a CD loaded with tools and various service packs. I have seen a few sites that list what they put on their USB memory stick. One I like is [What&#8217;s on my USB?](http://weblogs.asp.net/nleghari/articles/usb.aspx)

I prefer burning a CD than using a USB drive. Windows 98 is still out there and you might need to install a driver for that USB drive. Plus, I can leave that CD behind so I ever get asked to look at that PC again, they&#8217;ll have that CD.
