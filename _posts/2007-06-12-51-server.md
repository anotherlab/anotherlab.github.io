It&#8217;s been 6 months since I installed FreeNAS and it really has been like an appliance.  I back up my machine and my wife&#8217;s machine with just a few batch files, based on [robocopy](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/11/UtilitySpotlight/).  I could get fancy with remote backup tools and [so forth](http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/), but simple works.

I&#8217;ve been calling it $51 Server .  It started out as a white box pc that that I had custom built by [MWave](http://www.mwave.com/mwave/index.hmx?) a few years back.  I had needed a Netware box for some Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere testing and we bought a Dell Server with Novell Netware 5 on it.  It&#8217;s an interesting story of how I ended up with that box, but if you want to skip the story, just jump [here](http://anotherlab.rajapet.net/#gohere).

Netware was installed, but it needed to be configured.  The first thing it asked for was it&#8217;s designation.  I considered naming it &#8220;One&#8221;, but precious few would have caught the [reference](http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/VOY/episode/103571.html).   Usually when I get a server, I&#8217;ll ask a random co-worker for the first one word that comes to mind.  I was talking to one our tech support staff and his word was &#8220;pumpkin&#8221;.  

This bugged our IT manager to no end.  Normally, IT handles all of our server installs, and the server gets the name of some sort of predator.  Since I was the only one who knew Netware (which was a scary thought on many levels), the care and feeding of Netware box was my responsibility.

Getting back to Pumpkin.  After running it for a week, we had a somewhat urgent need for another Windows 2000 Server for a temporary remote access situation.  I wiped Pumpkin clean and IT installed Windows 2000 Server and named it Viper.

Temporary turned into permanent (about 6 years at this point) and I still needed a Netware box.  And of course, we did&#8217;t have any more money in our budget for another server.  But we did have enough money to have a cheap [whitebox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_box_(computer_hardware)) built.  So for a couple of hundred, we got a Celaron 1ghz box with 256MB memory and a 20GB drive.  Video and sound were on the motherboard and we had a 3Com ethernet card that had outlived it&#8217;s prior owner.  Using the usual method of selecting a server name, one of the QA people volunteered &#8220;moo&#8221; as the name.  She likes cows and it was short enough that you could easily type it with one hand with moving the hand.

Moo lasted 5 years without issues.   We used it test [Sybase](http://www.ianywhere.com/developer/asa.html) and it did was asked.  <a name="gohere"></a>Our support for Sybase ended last fall and so ended our need for dedicated Netware Server.  The company sold it to me for $1.  I spent $50 on a 250GB hard drive and installed FreeNAS on it.

So for the whopping sum of $51, I have a NAS box that is completely managed by a simple web interface.
