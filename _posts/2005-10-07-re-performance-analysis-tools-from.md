This processes trace files, including rollover files, and provides summary information, aggregates etc. The great thing is that it works out the sp calls from the text data so you don&#8217;t have to do it yourself. And then stores the data in a normalised database so you can perform your own queries on it.

If you have trace files you want to process using this tool you can load your data into a table add a derived column of EndTime that is dateadd(ms,duration,starttime), load the trace back into profiler and save to a file. Not great but it does work.
