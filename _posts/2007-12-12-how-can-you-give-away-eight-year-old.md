I came across a news article about the [Dutch couple](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=501281&in_page_id=1811 "Link to an article in the Dailly Mail") who gave up their eight year old daughter, who they had adopted as a baby from South Korea.  They claimed she didn&#8217;t fit in their life style.  What on Earth is going through these people&#8217;s minds?  She has been their daughter since she was four months old.  Since when did the disposal of second graders become a life style option?

This little girl has basically had her entire life shattered.  How does a eight year old come to terms with the fact her mommy and daddy don&#8217;t want her anymore?   I can&#8217;t imagine what she must be going through right now.  The family has been living in Hong Kong for the last few years, but the girl is still a South Korean citizen.  The Korean community in Hong Kong has stepped in to find her a new home,  but she&#8217;s going to need some help.  So does that Dutch family.  It&#8217;s just mind boggling that they could do this.
