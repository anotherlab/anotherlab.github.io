[The Ten Rules of Performance](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2004/02/10/270.aspx)

[Paul Vick](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/Rss.aspx) wrote a great article some time back about some rules for how to deal with performance issues. Originally written in 1997, they still hold true to day. When I first read this a year ago, I immediately put it on our Intranet site for all of our developers.
