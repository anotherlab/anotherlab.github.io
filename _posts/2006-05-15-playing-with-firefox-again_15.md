As much as I am an [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) bigot, I still roll out [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/central/) from time to time. This is one of those times. There are enough web sites that still do not work with Opera, that I m forced to use on of the more mainstream browsers. I limit my usage to IE to [Hotmail](http://www.hotmail.com/) and Outlook Web Edition. As much as I prefer the raw speed advantage of Opera, FireFox does have more cool toys for it. I added the [Performancing for FireFox](http://performancing.com/firefox/handbook/about) extension and I&#8217;m using it right now to post this message. It seems a quick way to toss up a quick blog posting without having to run a stand-alone blogging tool, or worse, Blogger&#8217;s online tool.
