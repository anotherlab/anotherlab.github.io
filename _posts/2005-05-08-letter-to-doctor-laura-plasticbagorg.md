Tom Coatesâ€™s [letter to Doctor Laura](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2000/05/a_letter_to_doctor_laura.shtml) is the best response that I have seen to people who declare that homosexual behavior is described as [an abomination in the Bible](http://mindprod.com/kjv/Leviticus/18.html).

> _Dear Dr. Laura,</p> 
> 
> Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God&#8217;s law. I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22  
> clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them.
> 
> When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?
> 
> I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus 21:7. In this  
> day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?  
> </em></blockquote>

> Of course these people are using King James Version of the Bible, where this text is pretty clear. The part they tend to skip is that the KJV isn&#8217;t a word for word translation of the original Hebrew text. Over at [ReligiousTolerance.org](http://www.religioustolerance.org/), they have a [nice page on this topic](http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibh.htm).
