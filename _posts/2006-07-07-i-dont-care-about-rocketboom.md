I have seen too many blog postings about [Amanda Congdon](http://www.amandaunboomed.blogspot.com/) leaving the [RocketBoom](http://www.rocketboom.com/) [vlog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoblog). There&#8217;s a he said/she said thing going on between her and the other owner. Since the world+dog seems to have a need to post about, I might was well too.

I first heard about RocketBoom when it became [available](http://research.tivo.com/rocketboom/) through [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com/1.0.asp). I subscribed to it for about a week or so, but i cancelled it. I found her [schtick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schtick) to be tiresome and annoying. She&#8217;s an acquired taste that I just couldn&#8217;t acquire. [Ze Frank](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/ "Click the giant baby") is much better at that kind of stuff.

In the end, it will probably work out well for both partners. Congdon has been getting plenty of job offers and RocketBoom has had tons of free publicity.
