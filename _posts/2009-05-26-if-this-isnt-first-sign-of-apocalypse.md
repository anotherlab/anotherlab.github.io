A few months back, I posted [this](http://anotherlab.rajapet.net/2009/02/on-this-episode-of-jon-and-kate-and.html "On this episode of “Jon and Kate and an American Chopper”…") as a joke.  Now I’m seeing pictures like this floating across the Internet:

[<img loading="lazy" title="The Gosselins riding with the Tuetuls" height="208" alt="The Gosselins riding with the Tuetuls" src="https://i2.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/_natoSxTaPFU/ShwVQ5liRjI/AAAAAAAAARY/l-D4rhUemhI/GosselinsTuetuls_thumb.jpg?resize=244%2C208" width="244" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i1.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_natoSxTaPFU/ShwVQtBk1sI/AAAAAAAAARU/BX6EasKES6U/s1600-h/GosselinsTuetuls%5B2%5D.jpg) 

It looks like Kate is riding off with Paul Senior and she’s the only one that looks happy.  I think it was for some TLC promotion, not an actual episode of either one of their shows.
