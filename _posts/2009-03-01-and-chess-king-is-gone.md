2009 Me: And by 1995, the last [Chess King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_King) had closed it’s doors [for good](http://the80srule.blogspot.com/2006/01/and-what-of-chess-king.html).

1979 Me: And you thought that was a [bad thing](http://83.223.124.20/mrdaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/ffe_d3_1.jpg)?

2009 Me: Well, it was a store that was around back in 1979.  It was once of those places we would have to walk by on the way out of the [mall](http://www.shop-cliftonparkcenter.com/).

1979 Me: I didn’t shop [there](http://onesizeneverfitsall.oes.org/2007/11/19/sorry-we-dont-carry-anything-your-size/).  Please, please don’t tell me that I shopped there in the future

2009 Me: No, we never did.  Well, we walked in, and we walked right back out without buying [anything](http://www.hookedonvintage.com/home/hov/page_1380_78/1970s_vintage_black_leather_vest_by_chess_king.html).

1979 Me: Thank you.  Or thank me, or us.

2009 Me: But we did go through a phase in the early ‘80s where we wore skinny ties….
