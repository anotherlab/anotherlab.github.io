A couple of weeks ago I was interviewed for the Hallway Conversations podcast. [That interview](http://hallwayconversations.com/podcast/episode-023-the-business-case-for-xamarin-with-chris-miller/ "Episode 023 – The Business Case for Xamarin with Chris Miller") is now on their site and can be [downloaded](http://feeds.feedburner.com/HallwayConversationsPodcastEpisodes "RSS Feed for Hallway Conversations") by your favorite podcast app. I talked with [Phil Japikse](http://www.skimedic.com/blog/page/www.skimedic.com/blog "Phil Japikse's blog"), [Stephen Bohlen](http://blog.unhandled-exceptions.com/ "Stephen Bohlen's blog"), and [Lee Brandt](http://blog.unhandled-exceptions.com/ "About Lee Brandt"). I had met Lee a few years back, when he did a presentation for TVUG about using [Kendo UI](http://tvug.net/post/October-Meeting-Kendo-UI-The-HTML5-Developer-Sword "Kendo UI: The HTML5 Developer Sword"). We talked about the business case for using [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/ "Xamarin Home Page") for developing native mobile applications.

We had a good conversation about the merits for using Xamarin and who the target audience is for those tools. I talked about how and why I ended up using Xamarin for [our first native app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fleetvision-work-orders/id723747021?mt=8 "Fleetvision Work Orders") and what hurdles I had to overcome to get that app done. And we talked about the costs of the Xamarin product and how that really wasn&#8217;t a factor in why our company decided to go that route.

I had a lot of fun doing the podcast.  If you are considering using Xamarin to write native apps for Android and iOS, it&#8217;s worth listening to this podcast episode and an [earlier one](http://hallwayconversations.com/podcast/episode-021-using-xamarin-for-cross-platform-development-with-jon-dick/ "Episode 021 – Using Xamarin for Cross-Platform Development with Jon Dick") with Xamarin&#8217;s Jon Dick,
