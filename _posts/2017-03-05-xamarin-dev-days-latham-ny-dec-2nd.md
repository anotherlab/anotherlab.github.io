Looking to start doing mobile app development with [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/), but don&#8217;t know where to start?  Then we have some good news for you.  Xamarin Dev Days is coming to the [Tech Valley](http://www.techvalley.org/).  We&#8217;ll be hosting the event on [Saturday, December 2nd](https://ti.to/xamarin/dev-days-latham-2017.ics), at the [new Latham office of Tyler Technologies](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.7563%2C-73.8228+%28Tyler+Technologies%2C+11+Cornell+Rd%2C+Latham%2C+NY+12110%29).  While it&#8217;s early to announce an event that is 9 months off, it&#8217;s still good to get the word out.

Xamarin Dev Days are community driven, hands-on learning experiences geared towards beginner mobile developers to help build, test, and connect native iOS, Android, and Windows apps.  We&#8217;ll spend the morning with sessions that introduce Xamarin ecosystem.  This will include an overview of Xamarin, Xamarin.Forms, and using cloud computing through Azure with Xamarin.

There will be a hands on lab in the afternoon that will walk everyone through how to build a Xamarin.Forms app that pulls data down from an Azure hosted database.

What is Xamarin?  Xamarin lets you deliver native Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows applications using your existing .NET skills and code.  You can build 100% native apps from a shared code base.  If you can do it in Swift, Objective-C, or Java you can do it in C# with Xamarin.

Tickets to this event are free, but you will need to register in advance.  Visit the [Latham Xamarin Dev Days page](https://ti.to/xamarin/dev-days-latham-2017) and then click the register button.
