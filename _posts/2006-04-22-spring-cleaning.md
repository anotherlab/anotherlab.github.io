While cleaning out the home office (E-Bay, here I come), I came across a souvenir from Hong Kong. It&#8217;s a shopping bag from [Watsons](http://www.aswatson.com/eng/retail_hb_watson.html), I have held on to it for nearly three years as a reminder of our trip. I don&#8217;t know why it holds sentimental value for me. Bags from the [Food Lion](http://www.foodlion.com/cgi-bin/sa/advantage.asp?template=map&transaction=locMap&recordId=937) we shop at on our trips to the Outer Banks mean nothing to me. I&#8217;m geneticly displosed to being a [pack rat](http://www.desertusa.com/mag99/apr/papr/packrats.html), that&#8217;s probably why I kept it. At any rate, out it goes. Don&#8217;t tell anyone about the two cans of Coke Light that I picked up in Guangzhou. They&#8217;re still in the fridge.
