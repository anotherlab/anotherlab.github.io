The authors of &#8220;Programming the .Net Compact Framework&#8221; have put the draft copies of their books (C# and VB.NET flavors) up for review as PDF downloads. You can get to them right [here](http://www.paulyao.com/cfbook/). I would grab them now, once the book is released, these files will probably get pulled.
