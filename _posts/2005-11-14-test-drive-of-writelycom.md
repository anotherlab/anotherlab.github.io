  This message was entered with <a href="http://www.writely.com/" target="blank_" title="The web word processor" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">writely.com</a>, a web based document collaboration tool. I usually enter my blog entries with <a href="http://www.wbloggar.com/" title="w.bloggar">w.bloggar</a>, but I&#8217;m game to try something new. It doen&#8217;t work with Opera 8.5, I&#8217;m using IE 6 right now. As a rule, I only use IE when I have to do, and that&#8217;s enough to limit my usage of writely. It does work, it&#8217;s just a little bit sluggish.
