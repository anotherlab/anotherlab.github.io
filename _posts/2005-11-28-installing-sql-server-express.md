There&#8217;s a good [article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsse/html/EmSQLExCustApp.asp "Embedding SQL Server Express into Custom Applications") on MSDN for controlling the installation of SQL Server Express. If you are bundling Express with your application, you may want to handle the Express options to make it simpler for the user. There some nice code for determining if Express is already installed.
