The National Geographic Society has running a project called the [&#8220;Genographic Project&#8221;](http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/) that is traces the geographic roots of our ancestors. By tracing DNA markers, it is believed that all living humans are descended from a group of about 2000 that lived in Africa about 60,000 years ago. The web site has an [interactive timeline](http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html) that lets you follow the various routes our ancestors took across the globe. They also have a pitch for you to submit your own DNS samples from a kit to contribute to the process.
