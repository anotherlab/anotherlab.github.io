_In the deserts of Sudan and the gardens of Japan,  
From Milan to Yucatan, ev&#8217;ry woman, ev&#8217;ry man.  
Hit me your rhythm stick, hit me, hit me  
Je t&#8217;adore, ich liebe dich  
Hit me, hit me, hit me  
Hit me with your rhythm stick  
Hit me slowly, hit me quick  
Hit me, hit me, hit me!  
In the wilds of Borneo  
And the vineyards of Bordeaux  
Eskimo, Arapaho  
Move their body to and fro  
Hit me with your rhythm stick, hit me, hit me  
Das ist gut, c&#8217;est fantastique  
Hit me, hit me, hit me  
Hit me with your rhythm stick.  
It&#8217;s nice to be a lunatic  
Hit me, hit me, hit me!  
Hit me, hit me, hit&#8230;. !  
In the dock of Tiger Bay  
On the road to Mandalay  
From Bombay to Santa Fe  
O&#8217;er the hills and far away  
Hit me with your rhythm stick, hit me, hit me  
C&#8217;est si bon, mm? Ist es nicht?  
Hit me, hit me, hit me  
Hit me with your rhythm stick.  
Two fat persons, click, click, click  
Hit me, hit me, hit me!  
Hit me, hit me, hit me!  
Hit me! (repeat)_

It&#8217;s not always about computers&#8230;.
