On Tuesday, July 22nd, we will be having a bonus [Tech Valley User Group](http://tvug.net/) meeting.  We usually skip the summer months, but [John Papa](http://johnpapa.net/) is going to be in town and he offered to do a presentation [how to consume WCF web services from Silverlight applications](http://johnpapa.net/all/silverlight-and-data-services-in-albany-ny/).  

John is currently working on new book, [Data Services with Silverlight 2](http://johnpapa.net/tags/data-services-with-silverlight/), so we get to see first hand what will be in the book.  He posted on his blog what the presentation will cover, anyone interested in doing Silverlight development should attend.  

John has posted an abstract for his presentation:

> Silverlight enables developers to use their .NET and XAML skills to develop Rich Internet Applications and to build data driven Silverlight applications that communicate with multi-tier architectures. This session will show how to build Silverlight 2 applications that communicate with and consume REST services and use LINQ to XML to manage XML content, show the various data binding techniques, and show how to use WCF to talk to various middle tier services including custom entity models and the Entity Framework.

If you would like to attend, TVUG meets at VersaTrans Solutions, at 4 British American Blvd, in sunny [Latham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latham%2C_New_York).  Click [here](http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?address=4%20British%20American%20Blvd&city=Latham&state=NY&zipcode=12110-1419&country=US&title=%3Cspan%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A0px%3B%22%20class%3D%22adr%22%3E%3Cb%20class%3D%22fn%20org%22%3EVersatrans%20Solutions%20Inc%3C%2Fb%3E%3Cbr%20%2F%3E%20%3Cspan%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A0px%3B%22%20class%3D%22street-address%22%3E4%20British%20American%20Blvd%20%23%202%3C%2Fspan%3E%20%3Cspan%20style%3D%22display%3Ainline%3Bmargin-bottom%3A0px%3B%22%20class%3D%22locality%22%3ELatham%3C%2Fspan%3E%2C%20%3Cspan%20style%3D%22display%3Ainline%3Bmargin-bottom%3A0px%3B%22%20class%3D%22region%22%3ENY%3C%2Fspan%3E%20%3Cspan%20style%3D%22display%3Ainline%3Bmargin-bottom%3A0px%3B%22%20class%3D%22postal-code%22%3E12110%3C%2Fspan%3E%2C%20%20%3Cspan%20style%3D%22display%3Ainline%3Bmargin-bottom%3A0px%3B%22%20class%3D%22country-name%22%3EUS%3C%2Fspan%3E%3C%2Fspan%3E&cid=lfmaplink2&name=&dtype=s) for a map of how to get there.
