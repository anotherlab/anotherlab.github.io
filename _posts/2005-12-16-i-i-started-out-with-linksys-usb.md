I ended up taking one of the SMC wireless bridges from one our Tivo&#8217;s and putting it on here PC. The SMC bridges get incredible reception, but they are twice the price (or more) of a decent 802.11g adapter. One a week, I take the bridge off the PC and slap on the Tivo so it can phone home and get the latest program updates. Hawking just announced a new 802.11g adapter with a directional antenna, the [HWU8DD](http://www.hawkingtech.com/products/productlist.php?CatID=32&FamID=60&ProdID=280). It looks like a cheap TV antenna but they are claiming a 8dBi gain in signal strength. In comparision, most 802.11 g adapters have a 1 or 2 dBi antenna. As you can see from the picture, the adapter has a small dish on it. This is a directional antenna, you get a better signal because you are aiming the adapter at the wireless access point and/or router. I may have to get of these puppies when they hit the retail market.

I have one of their [Hi-Gain laptop cards](http://www.hawkingtech.com/products/productlist.php?CatID=32&FamID=60&ProdID=219) and it gets an incredible signal, largely due to it&#8217;s directional antenna. If you need to add a wireless card to your notebook, you will be hard pressed to find one with better reception than this one.
