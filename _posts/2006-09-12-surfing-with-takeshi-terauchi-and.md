These files come courtesy of WFMU&#8217;s [Beware of the Blog](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/). Takeshi Terauchi plays surf guitar music the old schol way, these MP3s were from recordings that are four decades old. They sound the [Ventures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventures) with backed by a traditional Chinese opera (in a good way). WFMU has two complete albums, _This is Terauchi Bushi_, and _Let&#8217;s Go Classics_.

_Let&#8217;s Go Classics_ is a surf guitar interpretation of traditional classical pieces like Blue Daube Waltz and the theme from Swan Lake. Very different. 

Takeshi Terauchi started out as a sideman in Country/Western band, Jimmy Tokita & the Mountain Playboys. In 1962, Terauchi formed his first Eliki (Japanese slang for Electric) band, the Bluejeans, becoming Japan&#8217;s first Surf band. In &#8217;66, Terauchi quit the Bluejeans and formed the Bunnys, the group behind the two albums on WFMU.
