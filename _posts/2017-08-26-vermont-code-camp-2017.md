So it looks like I'll be speaking at [Vermont Code Camp 2017](https://www.vtcodecamp.org/) on September 16th.  I'll be doing a presentation on using [vector graphics with Xamarin](https://www.vtcodecamp.org/2017/sessions#vector-graphics-in-xamarin).  If you targeting multiple platforms, using vector graphics like SVG files lets you have one set of images for multiple resolutions.  It's a short session, but it will be useful for mobile developers of any stripe.

It's not too late to register for #VTCC9.  You can register [here](https://www.meetup.com/VTCode/events/240096766/) and it's free.  It's held at Champlain College in Burlington.  It's worth travelling up to visit Burlington in the fall.  It's right on Lake Champlain and it's a pretty part of the country.   You find the Vermont Code Camp on the twitters at [@vtcodecamp](https://twitter.com/vtcodecamp). They have a Slack channel at [vtcodecamp.slack.com](http://vtcodecamp.slack.com/) and you can join at [vtcodecamp.herokuapp.com](https://vtcodecamp.herokuapp.com/).

And one other thing.  [Mike Halsey](https://www.youtube.com/user/halseymike) has xray vision.  It's his super power.  This has nothing to do with the code camp, but it's worth mentioning.
