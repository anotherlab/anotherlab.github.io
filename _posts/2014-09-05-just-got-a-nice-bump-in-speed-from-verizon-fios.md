This morning I received an email from Verizon FiOS informing me that my upload speeds are now as fast as my download speeds.  I currently have the 50 Mbps download, 25 Mbps upload package.  I just checked with Ookla&#8217;s [speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net/ "Speedtest.net by Ookla") and my current speed is now 58/63.

For once, my upload speed is actually faster than the download speed.  One thing about FiOS, my connection speeds are almost always higher than what I am rated for.  I was a loyal Time Warner customer for years, but my upload speed was awful and the download/upload speeds approached, but never reached the speeds that I was paying for.
