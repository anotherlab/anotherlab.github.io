[Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com/) is how made available a large selection of images from their gallery [free for non-commercial use in social media](http://www.gettyimages.com/Creative/Frontdoor/embed "Getty Images is leading the way in creating a more visual world. Our new embed feature makes it easy, legal, and free for anybody to share our images on websites, blogs, and social media platforms."). For free. Which is pretty cool. There are times when you want to add an image to illustrate a point and a screen shot isn&#8217;t always applicable. And you may not have an image that you own that fits the theme.

It&#8217;s pretty simple to use. You just browse or search the Getty Catalog until you find an image that you want to use. If you hold hover your mouse over the image, you&#8217;ll see a pop-up window with additional details for that image. If that images has a link button, &#8220;</>&#8221;, then it&#8217;s available for linking on your blog or web site.

When you click the embed button, a new window will popup.  This window will have the HTML code needed to display the image.  It&#8217;s wrapped inside of an [<iframe>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe "The HTML <iframe> Element (or HTML inline frame element) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page.") and will have all of the branding required for the acceptable usage of the image.

As long as you are OK with the Getty branding at the bottom of the image, you now have a high quality source of free to use images for your blog.  Just paste that <iframe> block into your blog post and you are set to go.  Sometimes there is such a thing as a free lunch.
