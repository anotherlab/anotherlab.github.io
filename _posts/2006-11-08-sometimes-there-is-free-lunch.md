I had a nice little surprise in my email yesterday. It was a gift certificate from [VSoft Technologies](http://www.finalbuilder.com/home.aspx) for a one free license for [Automise](http://www.finalbuilder.com/automise.aspx). Evidently I received it because I own a license for [FinalBuilder](http://www.finalbuilder.com/finalbuilder.aspx), a fantastic tool for automating product builds.

With FinalBuilder, I can create a new build of one our applications from source control, through compiling, to building the installers, to sending out email to all interested parties that a new build is out.

Automise is basically FinalBuilder, but without the compiler specific tools. If you have a batch process that uses a motley collection of batch files and command line tools, then Automise will make your life simpler.
