David Byrne and Brian Eno have a new album out, &#8220;Everything That Happens Will Happen Today&#8221;.  It&#8217;s available exclusively through their web site, <http://www.everythingthathappens.com/>.  You can listen to the entire album on their site, or by using their streaming player right below this text.</p> 

I&#8217;ve been listening to it while writing this post and it&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s a nice mix of Eno&#8217;s music and Byrne&#8217;s lyrics and singing.

You can order the album from their website in various formats. They have 320kbps MP3 and FLAC, without any DRM. for $8.99. Yu can also get it as a CD plus the downloadable versions for $11.99. There is a deluxe package for $69.99 with all sorts of stuff for the diehard Byrne and Eno fans. It&#8217;s cool that they are selling it themselves. If they sold it through a record label on iTunes, they would get a tiny fraction of the $0.99 a song that iTunes charges.

This is their first collaboration since 1978&#8217;s [My Life in the Bush of Ghosts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLife-Bush-Ghosts-Brian-Eno%2Fdp%2FB000E5N634%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dmusic%26qid%3D1220735372%26sr%3D8-1&tag=christmillers-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)<img loading="lazy" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=christmillers-20&#038;l=ur2&#038;o=1" width="1" border="0" />.
