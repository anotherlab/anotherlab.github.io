Steve Trefethen&#8217;s [posting about Yahoo](http://www.stevetrefethen.com/blog/After10YearsImSeeminglyStillAStrangerToYahoo.aspx "Trefethen: After 10 years I'm seemingly still a stranger to Yahoo") is pretty dead on.  I used to use the various Yahoo apps and services, but I have slowly replaced them with the various services from Google.  I think  the problem was the development team saw too many bright and shiny objects and decided to implement them.

Yahoo&#8217;s email is an over-developed mess.  It&#8217;s trying to be the web version of Outlook.  Even Microsoft&#8217;s web version of Outlook isn&#8217;t trying to be a clone of the desktop version of Outlook.  With web-based email, I want to get in and read it in as simple a manner as possible.  Thanks to the [GMail Manager plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1320 "Allows you to manage multiple Gmail accounts and receive new mail notifications. Displays your account details including unread messages, saved drafts, spam messages, labels with new mail, space used, and new mail..."), I have notifications when email comes into my various gmail and Google Apps email accounts get mail.

I don&#8217;t want yet another proprietary IM client.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Yahoo&#8217;s IM, it&#8217;s just that no one that I IM with uses it.  I prefer to use [Trillian](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/), one client to serve them all.

It&#8217;s kind of sad.  I remember 10, 12 years ago when Yahoo was the only game in town for searching.  It got slower and slower to use and when [Altavista](http://www.altavista.com/) came out, I dropped Yahoo for speed and simplicity of a fast search app.  And I stayed with Altavista until Google came out of nowhere and changed the search engine game as we know it.
