This blog offers [newsreader syndication](http://www.commoncraft.com/archives/000528.html) using Atom. There&#8217;s a button labeled &#8220;ATOM MYBLOG&#8221; on this page that provides the contents in XML format using the Atom format. Why [Atom](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage) and not [RSS](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss)? Well, that&#8217;s what Blogger provides for blogs hosted on their server. If you are using a newsreader program or web site that subscribes to news feeds for you, the odds are that they will support both Atom and RSS.
