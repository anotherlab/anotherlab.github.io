I can&#8217;t wait to get the VI Toolkit for Windows.  It&#8217;s PowerShell cmdlets that let you manage VMWare.  To get an idea of what you can do with PowerShell and ESX Server, check out the [Automating VMware with PowerShell Lab Manual](http://blogs.vmware.com/vipowershell/files/vmworld_europe_2008_powershell_lab_7_manual.pdf), from the VMworld Europe 2008 conference.  You will be able monitor the status of VM&#8217;s on the ESX server and be able to control the VM&#8217;s remotely.  I&#8217;m curious to see of you would be able to take a running VM offline and move it to a storage volume.  That would make my life easier.

The VI PowerShell Blog mentioned that the [VI Toolkit will be Beta this month](http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/1051344/26886030), I can&#8217;t wait to get a hold of it.
