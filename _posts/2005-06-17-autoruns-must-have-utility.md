One of the best sources of free Windows system utilities is [Sysinternals](http://www.sysinternals.com/). Their [Autoruns](http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/autoruns.html) utility shows everything that gets auto-started when you machine boots. It checks more locations than the MSConfig utility does.
