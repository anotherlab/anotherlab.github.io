I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try this one yet, but it looks interesting. Microsoft now has a utility for creating file sets for your USB Flash Drive. This could be handy if you only have one flash drive and you keep several sets of files that could go on it.

Oddly enough it only works with Windows XP and it requires that the [.NET 1.1](http://www.microsoft.com/net/) runtime installed.
