This is a clever idea, I think I&#8217;m going to do this on the home PC&#8217;s. I&#8217;ll add links to email and of course, Amazon. I&#8217;m always curious about the status of the wireless [bridges](http://www.smc.com/index.cfm?event=viewLargeImage&localeCode=EN_USA&pid=586 "SMC2870 802.11g bridge") that I plugged the Tivo&#8217;s into, I can add links to them as well.

> Rather than use [&#8216;google&#8217;](http://www.google.com/) as my &#8220;homepage&#8221; I always create my own html file to use as a webpage, and store it on my hard drive.
