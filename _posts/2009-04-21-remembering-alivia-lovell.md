Last October, our company [constructed 8 playhouses that were donated to some patients](http://www.cbs6albany.com/news/project_1257705___article.html/latham_annual.html) at the [Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders](http://www.amc.edu/PATIENT/services/childrens/services/hemotology.html) at Albany Medical Center.  We do something like that every year.  It’s partly a team building exercise and partly a way a way to give back something to the community.  We put them together at the New Scotland Armory, across from the AMC.  Later on they were delivered to the homes, courtesy of [Bennett Contracting](http://www.bennettcontracting.com/).

While we were assembling the playhouses, the children were brought in to see the playhouses.  It was a pretty emotional scene for all of us.  I remember one little girl, cute as button. She was very shy and but she was excited about getting a new playhouse.  We just found out that Alivia Lowell passed away from leukemia last week at the age of 4.
