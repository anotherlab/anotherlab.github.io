That was a comment posted on a [Gothamist](http://www.gothamist.com/) blog entry about [making fake MTA posters](http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/12/07/mta_hack_make_y.php). The designer types are arguing over <strike>fonts</strike> typefaces. It&#8217;s very much like the Kirk vs Picard arguments found on the Star Trek boards.

Oh, and it would be [Kirk](http://my.voyager.net/~mikegr/kirk/).
