There’s a [post](http://blogs.mediapost.com/tv_board/?p=341) on the TV Board blog that really illustrates the differences between a TiVo and a cable company DVR.  A friend of the blog’s author (Mitch Oscar) was contacted by his cable operator, Comcast, and was offered a DVR.  We now join that conversation already in progress:

> “I don’t need your DVR, I already have a TiVo,” she said.
> 
> “Our DVR is the same as TiVo but it comes free with our service,” the sales rep adamantly replied. 
> 
> “Oh, really, well I have a lifetime membership with TiVo. Can you log on from any computer and schedule something to record?” she retorted. 
> 
> “No.”
> 
> “Can the DVR you offer be networked to my computer?”
> 
> “No.”
> 
> “Can I transfer shows between TVs?”
> 
> “No.”
> 
> “Can you store whatever you record on the DVR to your computer?”
> 
> “No.”
> 
> “Can you convert anything that you have recorded to play on your iPod video?”
> 
> “No.”
> 
> “Can you burn anything you have recorded on your DVR onto a DVD?”
> 
> “No.”
> 
> “Then I would have to say your DVR is nothing like a TiVo. All yours does is record.” 
> 
> ”I guess you’re right, it’s not the same.”

 

That really sums up the advantage that TiVo has over CableCo DVRs.  On the flip side, you do have to pay for TiVo and that’s a $200 or more that you don’t pay with the CableCo DVR.

I came across that post via the [TiVo Lovers blog](http://community.livejournal.com/tivolovers/666712.html).
