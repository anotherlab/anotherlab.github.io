You have to love a [good rant](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,2006031,00.html)&#8230;

> I hate Macs. I have always hated Macs. I hate people who use Macs. I even hate people who don&#8217;t use Macs but sometimes wish they did. Macs are glorified Fisher-Price activity centres for adults; computers for scaredy cats too nervous to learn how proper computers work; computers for people who earnestly believe in feng shui.

That&#8217;s from [Charlie Brooke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brooker)r, someone I will now start reading on a regular basis.Â  Having an iMac on my desk, I really loved this line:

> When I sit down to use a Mac, the first thing I think is, &#8220;I hate Macs&#8221;, and then I think, &#8220;Why has this rubbish aspirational ornament only got one mouse button?&#8221; Losing that second mouse button feels like losing a limb. If the ads were really honest, Webb would be standing there with one arm, struggling to open a packet of peanuts while Mitchell effortlessly tore his apart with both hands.
