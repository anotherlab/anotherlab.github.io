At a recent [ISSA](http://www.issa.org/) meeting, a team of FBI agents demonstated how to crack the 128 bit WEP encryption used by wireless routers. They used freely available tools and accomplished their task in about 3 minutes. Over at [Tom&#8217;s networking](http://www.tomsnetworking.com/index.php), they have an [article that covers how the FBI did this in great detail](http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article111.php).

It time to run the firewalls on the computers behind the router. I want a tool that can tell me if someone is trying to hack into my network.
