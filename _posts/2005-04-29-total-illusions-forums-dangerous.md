[Total Illusions &#8211; The Forums -> Dangerous Hacker!](http://www.totalillusions.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=328)

This is priceless. This link points to a English translation from a German IRC chat session. Some would be hacker claimed that he was kicked out and demanded the IP address of the chatroom moderator so he could attack the moderator&#8217;s PC. The moderator gives the future [Darwin Award](http://www.darwinawards.com/) winner the address 127.0.0.1. That address always points back to your PC. The transcript of the chat session has the hacker crowing about the files being deleted until his session abruptly ends.[](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/altircfaq.html)
