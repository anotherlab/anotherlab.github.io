> The remains of the world&#8217;s oldest noodles have been unearthed in China. The 50cm-long, yellow strands were found in a pot that had probably been buried during a catastrophic flood. Radiocarbon dating of the material taken from the Lajia archaeological site on the Yellow River indicates the food was about 4,000 years old. That date is about 1000 years older than what had been considered the [oldest known instance of noodles.](http://www.sodexhousa.com/cam_residential.asp)
