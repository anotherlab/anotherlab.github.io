In case you missed it, Microsoft has allowed Windows Live Writer (WLW) to go open source.&nbsp; The new project is called <a href="http://www.openlivewriter.org/" target="_blank">Open Live Writer</a> (OLW) and it’s taking the current version and breathing new life into it.&nbsp; WLW has been basically in a coma since 2012

It’s part of the .NET Foundation, an umbrella group for various open source projects that have come out of Microsoft.&nbsp; You read the announcement on the <a href="http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/blog/open-live-writer" target="_blank">.NET Foundation blog</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is cool, very cool.

When this blog was hosted on Blogger, WLW was my tool of choice for writing and editing blogs.&nbsp; When I moved to a self-hosted WordPress site, I used the built in editor on the siter.&nbsp; Which is actually quite good.&nbsp; Good enough that I never bothered to switch WLW over to the new site.&nbsp; Now that OLW will be picking up where WLW ended, I plan on using it it again.

I’m looking forward to seeing some plugins come over to OWL.&nbsp; A long time ago, I wrote a plugin for WLW to generate image galleries for your blog from <a href="http://www.smugmug.com" target="_blank">Smugmug</a>.&nbsp; It was so long ago that the Microsoft site for hosting plugins is long gone.&nbsp; 

I don’t think I would update the gallery plugin, with responsive design as the driver, it would be a better user experience to let the user go right to the SmugMug gallery.&nbsp; I would do one for pulling in images from SmugMug.&nbsp; Almost of the images on my blog come from my SmugMug galleries.&nbsp; I don’t store images with the blog.&nbsp; No point in duplicating the storage and it’s one less thing to worry about if I ever migrate the blog again.
