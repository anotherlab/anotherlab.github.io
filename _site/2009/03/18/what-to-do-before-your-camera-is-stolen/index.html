    <p>I just read about a guy in Poland who bought a camera on an on-line auction and it came with a memory card with someone’s travel pictures. He figured that the camera had been or lost or stolen. Based on a picture, he guessed the owner was from Australia.  So he registered as a new member on a <a href="http://www.photoforum.com.au/">Australian photography web forum</a> and solicited the members for help. </p>

<p>With a little bit of sleuthing, they tracked down the owners and sent them their pictures.  The last few postings on the forum indicated that he was trying to get his money back from the auction site so that he could send the camera to it’s rightful owners.  You can read the full message thread <a href="http://www.photoforum.com.au/showthread.php?t=11247">here</a>.  It’s a great story about how good people can be.</p>

<p>If I ever lose a camera, I hope that happens to me.  I would pay a reward to one back.  If not the camera, at least the memory card.  You can always get another camera, but you will never get back the memories that were recorded by that camera.   One that you can do is place a file on your memory card that would provide your contact information in case someone comes across your card.</p>

<p>Just create a text file with a file name of something like “If found.txt” and with add something like the following text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>This memory card was from a camera that was lost or stolen.  I will pay a reward and cover the costs of shipping to get this memory card back, with no questions asked.  Please mail the card to this address:<br /><br />John Smith<br />123 Main St<br />Springfield, NY 12345<br />USA<br /><br />If you include a return address, I will send a money order to cover the cost of shipping and for your time. If you would prefer alternative arrangements you can email me at someaddress@something.com<br /><br />thank you</pre>

</blockquote>

<p>It’s simple enough to do and it could get you pictures back if you lose camera on vacation.</p>
