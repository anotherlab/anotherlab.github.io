    <p>I’ve never subscribed to the “Hollywood Elite” theory about radical liberals being in charge of Tinseltown, but I do think more attention is paid to people who lean to the left.  And too much attention is being paid to the people who signed the petition demanding the release of convicted child molester Roman Polanski.  Would they do the same thing if his name was Roman Ray Polan and was a Dade County dish washer?  I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Polanski was arrested by Swiss police when he tried to enter Switzerland because of an outstanding 1978 arrest warrant.  He was to attend the Zurich Film Festival, where he would have been honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award for his film work.  Representing the Zurich Film Festival, Debra Winger made the following <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/39599337.html">comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We hope today this latest (arrest) order will be dropped. It is based on a three-decades-old case that is dead but for minor technicalities. We stand by him and await his release and his next masterpiece.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what if anything, was going through their minds when they signed the petition.  Roman Polanski plea bargained the charges of having given alcohol and drugs to a 13-year old, and then allegedly sexually assaulted her down to being guilty for having sex with a minor.  He then fled the country to avoid sentencing.  Those are the facts, no one has been unjustly accused here.</p>

<p>I have never heard of sexual assault being described as a minor technicality.  He took a 13 year old child, gave her drugs and alcohol and then sexually assaulted her.  It wasn’t statutory rape, the victim had testified that she pleaded with Polanski just to take her home.</p>

<p>I don’t buy the argument that it’s been 30 years and that it’s time to let it go.  Polanski was a fugitive from justice for the last 3 decades, he actively avoided going to locations where he could be expedited from.  He could have done his time and resumed his career decades ago.  He probably would received a one year sentence, would have been paroled long before the year was up.</p>

<p>That worst part of all of this is that the victim has to relive what happened to her all over again.  While Polanski was living openly in a country that refused to extradite him, she had to rebuild her live, knowing that he had got away without paying consequences.  The only good part for her was that he had already plead guilty, she doesn’t have to testify again.</p>

<p>I hope that the authorities in Switzerland ignore these people and honor the US extradition request.  The Swiss do not need to take a position one way or another about Polanski’s fate.  They just need to honor a legal expedition request.</p>

<p>Personally, I’m sad to see some of those names on that petition.  I don’t want to see their movies anymore.</p>
