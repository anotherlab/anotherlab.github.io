    <p>I have a service and I need to make sure that it doesn’t have a memory leak after running for a sustained length of time.  I’m doing all the good stuff in code to manage the garbage collection and I have the right tools to check for leaks in my code.  But I still want to monitor an instance of the service during regular usage.  I don’t need anything too finely grained, I just want to see if the memory usage is trending upwards.  There’s a good chance that I might have to deploy this out in the field, so I want something simple.  I could have used the Performance console, but I wanted something very simple to explain.  You can probably do this with a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/cscript_overview.mspx?mfr=true">CScript</a> batch file and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/wmi/default.mspx">WMI</a>, but I wanted something fast to load and fast to exit.</p>

<p>What I want is to log the memory usage to a text file, with each entry timestamped.  I was able to do this with almost all off the shelf parts.  I did have to write the timestamper, but that was a trivial task.  Since the home viewers will not have my service, pick a service or app of your own and play along.  I’ll describe what I did using FireFox as a substitute for the actual service.</p>

<p>In the excellent <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/PsTools.html">PsTools suite</a> over at <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">SysInternals</a> site, there is a utility named <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/PsList.html">PsList</a>.  It’s a combination of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=49AE8576-9BB9-4126-9761-BA8011FABF38&amp;displaylang=en">pmon and pstat</a> tools that works like a command line version of the “Processes” tab of Task Manager.  By default it lists information for all running processes, but you can filter it by service name or process ID.  I wrote a batch file to call PsList with the service name and the “-m” command line switch to print the memory usage.  PsList prints some banner information with the details.  Something like this:</p>

<pre>PsList 1.26 - Process Information Lister<br />Copyright (C) 1999-2004 Mark Russinovich<br />Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com<br /><br />Process memory detail for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremvax">Kremvax</a>:<br /><br />Name                Pid      VM      WS    Priv Priv Pk   Faults   NonP Page<br />firefox            3936  108952   41380   32748   36452   140201      8   54<br /></pre>

<p>All fine and good, but not pretty enough for a log file.  What I need was just the last line.  So I piped the output from PsList through the good ‘ol <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/find.mspx?mfr=true">FIND</a> command with “firefox” as the filter text.  With that, I can redirect the output to a file (with append).  I ended up creating a batch file named memlog.cmd that had the following commands:</p>

<pre>pslist -m firefox | find "firefox" &gt;&gt;c:\logs\memuse.txt</pre>

<p>That gave me the last line in a file.  But I still needed the time stamp. I thought about going through some script file sleight of hand with ECHO and DATE, but this is the Windows Server 2003 CMD.EXE.  It doesn’t have that skill set.  I could do with some 3rd party shells, but the goal is something I can deploy on a remote site without anyone having to pay for a tool or go through the hassle of installing something like <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Introduction_to_Monad.asp">Power Shell</a>.</p>

<p>Time to fire up <a href="http://www.borland.com/us/products/delphi/index.html">Delphi</a> and create a little command line app that would take text coming in as standard input and send it back out as standart output, but with a timestamp prepended to the text.  The source code has less text in it than the previous sentence.  If you have Delphi, the following code will give you that mini-tool.  I used Delphi 7, any of the Win32 versions should do.</p>

<pre><br /><b>program</b> dtEcho;<br /><br />{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}<br /><br /><b>uses</b><br />  SysUtils;<br /><br /><b>var</b><br />  s: <b>string</b>;<br /><b>begin</b><br />  ReadLn(s);<br />  WriteLn('[' + FormatDateTime('yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm', Now) + '] ' + s);<br /><b>end</b>.<br /></pre>

<p>There’s no banner or error checking.  I didn’t need any of that and I wanted to keep it light.  By adding dtEcho to my batch file like this:</p>

<pre>pslist -m firefox | find "firefox" | dtecho &gt;&gt;c:\logs\memuse.txt</pre>

<p>I now get output like this:</p>

<pre>[2006-07-28 23:14] firefox            3936  536904   61324   51244   57384   445377     90  249<br />[2006-07-28 23:15] firefox            3936  538176   60844   50764   57384   449193     91  249<br />[2006-07-28 23:16] firefox            3936  538212   60620   50528   57384   455935     91  249<br /></pre>

<p>The output only goes down to the minute, I’m tracking the memory usage every 10 minutes, I didn’t need to make the timestamp that granular. If I needed it, I just need to make a slight change the dtEcho source code and it will print the seconds.</p>

<p>To run that batch file, I just used the scheduled tasks control panel applet and set it to run off of my account. For remote deployment, that would probably be the hardest step.</p>
