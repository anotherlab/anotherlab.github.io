    <p>There’s an interest web page called “<a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/SupportCD/FirefoxMyths.html">Firefox Myths</a>” that takes some of the more common claims associated with <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> (it’s faster, it’s more secure, it’s a <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml">floor wax and a dessert topping</a>) and examines each claim. While I’m sure that busting all of those myths is going to bug a lot of people who prefer Firefox, I think he’s dead on.</p>

<p>While I like the idea of Firefox, it’s implementation bugs me. It’s slower than IE and much slower than <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/desktop/">Opera</a>. IE gets a startup boost by being part of the OS, Opera is just fast. I also prefer the Opera UI, it handles the MDI tabs much better than Firefox does. You can extend Firefox to get the same functionality with extensions, but I prefer that nice shiny out of the box experience.</p>

<p>I do have Firefox running on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/imac/g4/">iLamp</a>. It’s arguably less annoying than Safari.</p>

<p>I fully admit to being an Opera bigot. It’s faster and more secure than the other two, and I prefer the UI. The latter reason is purely subjective, but the other two reasons are real. There are plenty of sites that don’t fully support Opera, it’s mainly a sin of ommission. Opera supports the web standards as the others and it lets you change the user agent string on the fly to get past some of the sites that don’t allow Opera.</p>

<p>And the people behind Opera have a good sense of humor. Three years ago, Microsoft’s MSN portal changed it’s code and deliberately excluded Opera users. When Opera Software found out about, they complained to MS and then released the “<a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2003/02/14/">Bork</a>” edition of Opera. It worked just like the regular edition, unless you were visiting the MSN site, there it would translate all of the text into the language of the famous Swedish Chef from the Muppet Show: <a href="http://www.almac.co.uk/chef/chef/chef.html">Bork</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/xx-bork/">Bork</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Chef">Bork!</a></p>

I have disabled comments on this post because S/N ratio was starting to drop. There were some good comments, but I didn’t want this post to turn into a “Bash FireFox” post. That was never my intent.</p>
