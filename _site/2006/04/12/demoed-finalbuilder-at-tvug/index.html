      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>Last month I demoed <a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com/finalbuilder.aspx">FinalBuilder</a> at <a href="http://www.tvug.net/site/1/default.aspx">TVUG</a>. That was an interesting experience. I have managed to spend my entire career without having to do a public presentation. I was supposed to do one at the ’98 BorCon on QuickReport, but I got bumped by another presenter who wanted that glory. He did his presentation using a version of QuickReport that was not ready for prime time and he told me later (before he found out that I was the person that he bumped) that it was a very unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>But, as <a href="http://www.nbc.com/My_Name_Is_Earl/">Earl</a> says, “That’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma">Karma</a>“. I strayed enough from the topic. I’ve been using FinalBuilder for a couple of months now and I love it. FinalBuilder is an automated build and process management tool that is easy to use and extremely powerful. I use to build our applications and to deploy them to our QA environments. What I used to do with limited batch files, I now have a full IDE for design and powerful error handling. Plus reports and email notifications.</p>

<p>Shawn Gwin of TVUG asked me to do a presentation on FinalBuilder. I created a basic FinalBuilder project that would run from a non-networked laptop. It did the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Retrieved the latest source from <a href="http://ufies.org/archives/000482.html">Visual Source Safe</a> for the sample project. In real life, I use <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">Vault</a>, but for the purposes of this demo, VSS was <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=VSS+%2Bcorrupt">safe enough</a> to use.</li>
  <li>Read version number and other resource information from a file. I store the version number parts in a .ini file and include in source control. This makes it easy to control the version number in a multiple user environment.</li>
  <li>Built that project with <a href="http://www.borland.com/us/products/delphi/index.html">Delphi</a>. TVUG is a .NET group, but for this demo, the actual compiler used really didn’t matter.</li>
  <li>Create an installer for the application using <a href="http://www.wise.com/wfwi.asp">Wise for Windows</a>.</li>
  <li>Sent an email to myself that the build was successful.</li>
  <li>Created text and HTML versions of the build log.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project had full error handling and enough smarts to only compile when the files had changed. All of this is easy to do with FinalBuilder, no scripts were written.</p>

<p>Since this was a user group presentation, I was bound by law to use a PowerPoint presentation. You can make the argument that Powerpoint is used <a href="http://www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/sld001.htm">way</a> <a href="http://www.presentations.com/presentations/delivery/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000482464">too</a> <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~holeton/edmedia/tsld001.htm">much</a>, but since this was my first presentation ever, I needed all the support I could get. I ended up creating a basic PowerPoint deck to provide a frame of reference for the presentation. I’m not big on PowerPoint special effects, so I used no graphics and both colors (black and not black). As it ended up, I never used my presentation.</p>

<p>I emailed the FinalBuilder people and told them I was doing a presentation and asked if they had any tips. They promptly sent back a few suggestions and a nicely PowerPoint deck to use. I started off with their presentation and then went straight into my demo project and walked through each line for the group.</p>

<p>The group. This was not a well attended presentation. I believe that there may have been nearly 10 people total. Of that 10, maybe 5 people had any real interest or understanding of what they could use FinalBuilder for. That was kind of a letdown. I don’t know if that was just a bad month or if the people that usually come had no interest in a build tool.</p>
