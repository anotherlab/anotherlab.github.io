    <p>I was doing coding on my home machine when the phone rang.  The Caller ID said “Out of State”.  When Caller ID comes up like that, I know the call will not be in my benefit.</p>

<p>I answered the phone and there was a 30 second delay before someone speaks on the other end.  I like to imagine that I was called by an <a href="http://www.omnicorp.com/products/ed-209.php">ED-209</a> and it’s cycling down and that’s why there is a delay.</p>

<p>“Hello this is Andy from Windows, we have reported a security report with your computer.  You have a virus and we are calling to fix it.”</p>

<p>Ok, this is the start of a scam.  The right thing to do here is to just hang up.  Don’t engage these idiots.</p>

<p>So I decided to play along.  I was testing some code that I had written with a virtual machine of Windows 7 running.  I had a few brain cycles to waste while I was working. This is what I replied back with:</p>

<p>Me: “Oh no, what happened?  How do we fix it”<br />
Andy: “We are from Windows, we received reports of malware running and you need to fix it”<br />
Me: “Ok!  What do we do?”</p>

<p>Andy: “Can you go to your computer? Take your time, I can wait.”<br />
Me: “I’m sitting right in front of it now”.<br />
Andy: “Please go to the computer”<br />
Me: “I’m already at the computer. Take your time figuring that out, I can wait”</p>

<p>Andy: “Look at your keyboard. On the left side there is a button spelled C-T-R-L. Do you see that key?”<br />
Me: “Yes, I do”<br />
Andy: “What is on the key to the right of the CTRL key?”<br />
Me: “It has a window on it. I love this key. It lets me do things”.</p>

<p>Andy: “Ok, I need to to press that window key and while holding it down, press the R key and then let go.<br />
Me: “Ok, I did it”<br />
Andy: “What do you see?”<br />
Me: “Solitaire”<br />
Andy: “What did you say?”<br />
Me: “Solitaire just started”<br />
Andy: “That should not happen”<br />
Me: “Oh no, is that the virus?”<br />
Andy: “Yes that is your virus. Please close Solitaire press the window key then the R key”<br />
Me: “Solitaire!”</p>

<p>We repeat the Win-R shenanigans a few more times, then I tell him that the Run dialog came up.</p>

<p>Me: “A window named Run just came up.  Is that the virus?”<br />
Andy: “No, that is not the virus.  What does this window have on it?”<br />
Me: “The name of the program, folder, document, or Internet weasel, and Windows will open it for you.”<br />
Andy: “Do you see a space panel next to the word open?”<br />
Me: ” A SPACE PANEL?  Did NASA install a virus on my PC?”<br />
Andy: “No, NASA did not install a virus on your PC. It’s a box that you can type text into”<br />
Me: “Do you mean the drop down combo box?”<br />
Andy: “Yes, please type <strong>eventwr</strong> into the panel”<br />
Me: “It started solitaire again. Is this the virus?”<br />
Andy: “Lets try this again..”</p>

<p>Andy walk me through the launching of the  Windows Event Log Viewer”. I had a idea of what he was going to do next, so I decided to ramp up things…</p>

<p>Andy: “What do you see now?”<br />
Me: “It says <strong>Event Viewer</strong>”<br />
Andy: “Great! Now we can show you evidence of the malware on your PC. On the left side of the <strong>Event Viewer</strong>, you should see <strong>Event View Local.  </strong>Can you read to me what is listed under that?”<br />
Me: “Custom Views, Windows Log, Application and Services Logs, Subscriptions, Pizza”.</p>

<p>That threw Andy and he made me repeat that list twice. But that didn’t stop Andy…</p>

<p>Andy: “I want you to left click <strong>Custom Views</strong> twice, quickly”<br />
Me: “Ok!  Did this fix the virus?”<br />
Andy: “No, this will show you that you have a virus.  You should see some text underneath <strong>Custom Views</strong>.  Please read them to me.”<br />
Me: “Cisco, Waffle, Administrative Events”<br />
Andy: “Please click twice on <strong>Administrative Events.</strong> Now you will see the virus activity. Did you click on it?”<br />
Me: “Yes, I did. No virus here! Yay!”<br />
Andy: “No, do you see the red error messages? That’s from the virus”</p>

<p>Of course you would see error messages with the red icon in the event log. It wouldn’t be Windows if some app or service wasn’t complaining about something.  But I was going to make him work a little harder…</p>

<p>Me: “I don’t see any error messages”<br />
Andy: “What?  There must be something there”<br />
Me: “Nope”<br />
Andy: “What does it say at the top?<br />
Me: “Administrative Events and the Number of events is zero”</p>

<p>Andy is trooper and continues on. He has me click on the <strong>Application Log</strong> under <strong>Windows Logs</strong>. There’s always an error or two there.  I play dump and tell him that there are only information messages</p>

<p>Andy: “Read me what it says for the first one”<br />
Me: “The disk fragmenter successfully completed defragmentation on C:”<br />
Andy: “That is your virus. We can fix you. You need to go to our website and we can fix it from there. Do you know which web browser you have”<br />
Me: “Yes, I have the Internets. It’s running now”<br />
Andy: “What do you see on your Internet?”<br />
Me: “This page could not be loaded”<br />
Andy: “You have to have Internet or we can’t help”<br />
Me: “I have Internet, I can get to the Bing”</p>

<p>Andy walks me through how to identify the address field and asks me to type in http://www.support.me.  That page will redirect to a LogMeIn page.  LogMeIn is not part of the scam, but they provide tools so that support people can take remote control of your PC to fix problems.  That’s usually a good thing. Just not in this case.</p>

<p>So that tells me that they are going to take over my PC remotely. Even though I’m playing with a virtual machine, I’m still not going to let that happen…</p>

<p>Andy: “Do you see the <strong>start download</strong> button?”<br />
Me: “No”<br />
Andy: “What do you see?”<br />
Me: “Technology Support for a Connected World”</p>

<p>I was on support.com and we played the random url game for a minute.  I then went to www.support.me</p>

<p>Me: “I keep going to www.support.me, but it keeps going to LogMeIn Rescue. Is that the virus?”<br />
Andy: “No, that is the tool we use to fix your PC.  You see a place to enter a code?  I need you to enter that code” <em>[Andy reads a 6 digit code to me]</em> “and press the download button”<br />
Me: “It doesn’t work”<br />
Andy: “What?  Please try it again, you maybe typed it wrong</p>

<p>Of course I was typing it in wrong.  I was following the universal programmers rule of typing in all “9”s and hoping that it was an invalid code.  it came back as invalid and with an error message.</p>

<p>Me: “It says <strong>Code does not exist. Please contact your support provider.</strong>”<br />
Andy: “OK, I get you another code”</p>

<p>Andy gets another code and I report back that I get the same message.  I can hear some tension in his voice now.  He’s so close to taking over my machine.  Andy tells me that he is putting his support manager on the line.  I go through the same process with both codes with new guy.  He gives up and says that I am being tranferred over to his IT guy.  This guy does does the same bit and coughs up a 3rd code. I drive this guy nuts by repeating the numbers back to him transposed.  He gets annoyed and hangs up on me.</p>

<p>So I click the “Report Abuse” button on the LogMeIn page and call the number listed on that page.  After a remarkably short time on hold, I get a friendly CSR on the line and I start telling her what happened.  She asked if I was given a 6 digit code.  I told her that I had three of them.  She asked how I got three and when I explained that I kept repeating the error message, she started laughing and said that I had made her day.</p>

<p>The end result was the accounts that these scammers had opened with LogMeIn  have been burned and the LogMeIn people are going to look into how they were registered.  Did I stop this people? No, they’ll just open some new accounts.  But I did waste their time, the time spent trying to get me to play their game meant that one less person was targeted by them today.</p>
