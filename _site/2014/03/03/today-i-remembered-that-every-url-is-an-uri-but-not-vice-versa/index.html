    <p>I was writing some validation code for a desktop app and there are some fields require web page URLs.  My first thought was to a regular expression to validate the input, then this quote came to mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.<br />
<a href="http://www.jwz.org/">Jamie Zawinski</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regular expressions can solve many problems, but if there is a method in the .Net Framework that will solve the problem, I’ll use that first.</p>

<p>I started off using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.uri.iswellformeduristring(v=vs.110).aspx" title="Uri.IsWellFormedUriString Method">IsWellFormUriString</a> method from the Uri class.</p>

<p>I created a string extension method called ValidateUrl() and tried it with the following examples</p>

<ol>
  <li>http://foo.com</li>
  <li>htp.foo.com</li>
  <li>ftp://foo.com</li>
  <li>what://foo.com</li>
</ol>

<p>You can see the results of those examples with the following <a href="http://dotnetfiddle.net/1Nry5H">.Net Fiddle</a>:</p>

<p>The first is valid and we expected that. The 2nd is not valid and is expected. The 3rd is valid and I didn’t account for that in the code. The last one, <strong>what://foo.com</strong>, that was unexpected. That is obviously not a valid URL. Or at least not valid for the purposes of my app.</p>

<p>But I wasn’t check to see if the URL was valid, I was checking to see if the URI was valid. A URI consists of a scheme name (“http”, “ftp”, “mail”, etc), followed by the “:” character, and then by the path the resource. The Uri.IsWellFormedUriString method does not validate the scheme name, it’s just validating that the resource was assembled correctly.</p>

<p>Validating for a web page URL would be on me. I can use Uri.IsWellFormedUriString, but I would need to add an additional check to verify that the URI started with http:// or https://. With that modification, the example from above becomes <a href="http://dotnetfiddle.net/uw4uqA">this Fiddle</a>:</p>

<p>And with the same inputs, I now get the results that I need. The one that starts with “ftp:” is a valid URL, I’m returning it as invalid because that meets the requirements of my app. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>While testing the code, I came across an example of a valid URL that IsWellFormedUriString will return as invalid. It fails on URLs with embedded unicode characters. Like this one:</p>

<p>http://foo.com/unicode_✪_</p>

<p>This apparently broke in .NET 4.5 and was logged as <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/778454/breaking-change-to-uri-iswellformeduristring-in-net-4-5" title="Breaking change to Uri.IsWellFormedUriString in .NET 4.5">bug</a>. And according to the notes attached to that bug, it’s not going to be fixed any time soon. For this project, I know that the URLs that could be entered in by the user would not have unicode characters, so I don’t have to worry about that.</p>

<p>If I did have to handle unicode characters, that’s when I would use a regular expression. Someone already went <a href="http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex">in search of the perfect URL validation regex</a> and found one from <a href="https://twitter.com/diegoperini">Diego Perini</a> that handles all sorts of use cases.</p>

<p>Weighing in at 502 characters, this handles just about any valid URL.</p>

<pre>_^(?:(?:https?|ftp)://)(?:\S+(?::\S*)?@)?(?:(?!10(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})(?!127(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})(?!169\.254(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?!192\.168(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?!172\.(?:1[6-9]|2\d|3[0-1])(?:\.\d{1,3}){2})(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[01]\d|22[0-3])(?:\.(?:1?\d{1,2}|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])){2}(?:\.(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-4]))|(?:(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+-?)*[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+)(?:\.(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+-?)*[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}0-9]+)*(?:\.(?:[a-z\x{00a1}-\x{ffff}]{2,})))(?::\d{2,5})?(?:/[^\s]*)?$_iuS</pre>

<p>In that format, that regex is what you would call write-once code. Diego posted a commented version of it <a href="https://gist.github.com/dperini/729294">as a gist</a>, you can read that without your eyes bleeding.</p>
