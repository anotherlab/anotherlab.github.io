    <p>I just did a simple hardware hack to my <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/smartphones/htc-wp-8x/">HTC 8X</a> phone.  I have been having random problems where the phone loses it’s ability to make calls or to send SMS messages.  And it will do a spontaneous reboot every once in a while.  So I took the SIM card out and stuck some tape to the back of it and put it back in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" style="float: left;" onmouseover="this.src='http://anotherlab.smugmug.com/photos/i-MV2XkcG/0/M/i-MV2XkcG-M.png';" alt="HTC 8X" src="https://i0.wp.com/anotherlab.smugmug.com/photos/i-MV2XkcG/0/Th/i-MV2XkcG-Th.png?resize=150%2C132" width="150" height="132" data-recalc-dims="1" /> These problems has been going on for months and a bunch of people have been complaining about it on the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wptext-htc8x?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=All&amp;tm=1393051071455">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://community.verizonwireless.com/thread/793465">Verizon forums</a>.  Some people have been reporting that the problem goes away if you change the settings, but that doesn’t appear to be the fix.  I think there are two problems, one hardware related with the SIM card tray, the other one a firmware issue.</p>

<p>The firmware problem appears to be related to what <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wptext/after-gdr2-on-verizon-htc-8x-intermittent-cant/3f521fa3-2fa3-463c-a175-52d3f00df6a0?page=4">has been reported</a> as an issue with SMS traffic and with which switch the phone is connected to at the time.  When this happens, I have to put the phone in “Airplane Mode” and then back to normal.  Usually, I get SMS functionality again after doing so.    Until Verizon and HTC decide to fix this, there’s nothing else I can do about that.  Short of a miracle in the 8.1, I’m not expecting any fixes on that.</p>

<p>The other problem is that the SIM card appears to lose it’s connection with the phone.  When that happens I lose voice and SMS and sometimes the phone reboots.  That I can try to fix.  A few people have reported fewer SMS and reboot issues after padding the SIM card with tape.  A couple of pieces of tape are enough to keep the SIM card in tighter contact with the phone.  So I took the card out and applied some tape, as seen in the following photo:</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/anotherlab.smugmug.com/photos/i-BLfnzDz/0/O/i-BLfnzDz.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/anotherlab.smugmug.com/photos/i-BLfnzDz/0/S/i-BLfnzDz-S.jpg?resize=220%2C300" width="220" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>You can see the edges of the tape past the edges of the card.  It’s actually a MicroSIM card and it fits in a little tray that goes into the side of the phone.  You don’t need much tape.  I used clear shipping tape, just two pieces were enough.  The SIM card tray went in with a snug fit.  Hopefully my ability to send SMS messages will be a little more reliable.  I like this phone, but being able to make calls and send text messages should be the more reliable part of a phone.</p>
