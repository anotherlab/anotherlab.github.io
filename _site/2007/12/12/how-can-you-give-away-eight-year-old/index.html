    <p>I came across a news article about the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=501281&amp;in_page_id=1811" title="Link to an article in the Dailly Mail">Dutch couple</a> who gave up their eight year old daughter, who they had adopted as a baby from South Korea.  They claimed she didn’t fit in their life style.  What on Earth is going through these people’s minds?  She has been their daughter since she was four months old.  Since when did the disposal of second graders become a life style option?</p>

<p>This little girl has basically had her entire life shattered.  How does a eight year old come to terms with the fact her mommy and daddy don’t want her anymore?   I can’t imagine what she must be going through right now.  The family has been living in Hong Kong for the last few years, but the girl is still a South Korean citizen.  The Korean community in Hong Kong has stepped in to find her a new home,  but she’s going to need some help.  So does that Dutch family.  It’s just mind boggling that they could do this.</p>
