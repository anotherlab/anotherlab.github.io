    <p><a href="http://www.andybeaulieu.com/Home/tabid/67/EntryID/61/Default.aspx">Andy</a> just tagged me.  This is the <a href="http://www.soloseo.com/blog-tag-tree.html">geek version</a> of tag.  I share 5 things about myself, then I tag 5 other people.  The hard is finding 5 other people who haven’t yet been tagged.</p>

<p>What don’t you know about me?</p>

<ol>
  <li>I used to be a <a href="http://www.dataaccess.com/normal.asp?pageid=712">DataFlex</a> programmer (During the 1st Bush administration).  Mainly for DOS, but some UNIX tossed in.  Once I got called by <a href="http://www.cdta.org/">CDTA</a> to fix a bus routing application that ran on some oddball mainframe version of Unix.  I had just flew in from Amsterdam (not that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_%28NY%29">Amsterdam</a> , this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>) and I was jet lagged beyond all belief.  I kept jacking the hourly rate up, hoping they would go away.  They didn’t and when the rate reached to the point where I felt guilty about blowing them off, I spent the next 12 hours in a bus garage rebuilding corrupt index files.</li>
  <li>I taught myself C using <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/lattice-c">Lattice C</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a>.</li>
  <li>My wife and I met on a blind date.</li>
  <li>The first time I earned money from something that I did on the computer was for a simple disk utility named “Easy Load” for the Commodore 64.  It was published in <a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/gazette/" data-wplink-edit="true">February 1988 edition</a> of <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/compute-s-gazette">Compute!s Gazette</a>.  That was back in the days when you had to type the code in from the magazines.  And they got it wrong and transposed some code, turning my little utility into a weapon of destruction.  I still got paid though.</li>
  <li>I once taught a dog to jump in and out a living room window on command.  My friend <a href="http://www.arctheband.com/">Jack</a> used to be a band named Operation Pluto.  The leader singer, Bill, had one of those little, yappy type of dogs.   Bill’s landlord wouldn’t let the dog, named “Zero”, live in Bill’s apartment.   So Bill asked Jack to watch the dog for a days (Jack had this little tiny house) while he worked things out with the landlord.The days turned to weeks and Jack got stuck taking care of the dog, and he wasn’t terribly diligent about feeding Zero.   I decided to see if Zero could be taught any tricks.  Since Zero was always hungry, he was quite amenable to learning new tricks, especially if food was involved. 
    After a remarkably short amount of time and dog biscuits, I had taught Zero to jump out the living room window on command.  The window was above a couch, and he would use the couch as a launch pad. A similar command would launch the hapless mutt back in through the window.</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The next time Bill came over to the house for band rehearsal, I was already there.  He came in and the first thing he said was &amp;#8220;Where&amp;#8217;s Zero?&amp;#8221;  Zero was outside in the yard playing.  I innocently said, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll get him&amp;#8221; and then yelled &amp;#8220;Zero! In!&amp;#8221;.  About 5 seconds later, the dog comes flying in through the window.

Bill is stunned and more than slightly pissed off at me.  He said &amp;#8220;What just happened?&amp;#8221;  I replied, &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve been teaching Zero new tricks.  Zero! Out!&amp;#8221;.  The dog ran to the couch and jumped out the window.   I then had Zero jump back in once more, so Bill could appreciate the sound of the dog&amp;#8217;s claws scrambling against the side of house as he jumped up to the window and pulled himself back in.  Needless to say, Bill took Zero home again.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; 

Now, I have to figure out who to tag. I pick Shawn, Andy, Mark, Renard, and Lou.  I was going to tag Ed Dague, but I don&amp;#8217;thave his email address.
