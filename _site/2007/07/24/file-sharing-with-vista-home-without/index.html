    <p>After having several PC implosions, we now have two new Vista boxes at home. Both have Vista Home Premium installed. I’m used to the relative stability of XP Pro, but I figured I would give Vista a shot. For the most part it has gone very well, but I made sure that each machine was going to be able to run Vista.</p>

<p>My machine is a <a href="http://anotherlab.rajapet.net/2007/05/time-to-get-new-pc.html">custom built box</a> from <a href="http://www.mwave.com/mwave/index.hmx?">MWave</a>, my wife’s is a Dell box. She has Intel, I have AMD, but they are both dual core machines with 2GB of RAM and decent video cards.</p>

<p>My wife and my kids have user accounts with out passwords. The machine has the usual security apps installed and is behind a router firewall. Their accounts are set as Standard User. I have a password protected admin account on each box. My wife has a Standard User account on each box.</p>

<p>We share a printer from my machine. I could print from my wife’s PC, but she couldn’t. She kept getting a login pass prompt and finally an error message about being able to validate credentials. It took a little while to figure out, but finally I remembered that out of the box, Vista wont let non-password protected accounts from remotely authenticating. That means that you need a password on your account to access network resources on another Vista box.</p>

<p>A fair amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_%28verb%29">Googling</a> kicked up a few <a href="http://forums.techguy.org/windows-vista/542469-folder-sharing-issues.html">suggestions</a> to run gpedit.msc (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Policy">Group Policy</a> Editor). Most of the suggestions were of this type:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Run gpedit.msc<br />
Go to Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Local Policies / Security Options<br />
Double click on Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console login only<br />
Disable this option</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One little problem. You only get gpedit.msc with XP Pro or Vista Business (or Ultimate). Thanks for playing the Home version of Windows, you don’t get that useful little utility.</p>

<p>Fortunately for this setting all gpedit.msc is doing is writing to the registry. All you have to do is to edit the following key:</p>

<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa</p>

<p>and edit the value of LimitBlankPasswordUse from 1 to 0. After you do that, you can now share printers and folders across Vista (and XP) with accounts that do not have passwords.</p>

If you install Service Pack 1 (SP1) after making this change, you’ll need to do it again as SP1 restores this setting back to the default.</p>
