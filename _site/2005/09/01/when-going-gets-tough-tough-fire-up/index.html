    <p>Just about everyone on the planet knows what Katrina did. And most of us know that New Orleans has been all but abandoned. But not everyone left. <a href="http://www.directnic.com/" title="http://www.directnic.com/">DirectNIC</a>, a web hosting company, is running from a dry and secure skyscraper in New Orlean’s central business district. They have enough backup power for a few weeks and it looks like they will need it. In addition to keep their customer’s web sites running, they have a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/interdictor/" title="The Interdictor">blog</a> documenting what they are going through and what they are seeing from their vantage point. It’s required reading folks.</p>

<p>It’s a compelling drama. It’s very much like reading a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson" title="Hunter S. Thompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> story. You feel like civilization is coming apart at seams. I IM’ed the author of the blog. I really didn’t have anything to say him other than he rocks. They are living in a <a href="http://www.hit-n-run.com/cgi/read_review.cgi?review=13383_gislef" title="In Sensurround!">twisted</a> <a href="http://www.theforbidden-zone.com/" title="The Forbidden Zone">Charlton</a> <a href="http://www.scifimoviepage.com/omega.html" title="The Omega Man">Heston</a> <a href="http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/soylent-green.html" title="Soylent Green">movie</a> and they are the good guys.</p>

<p>In addition to the blog, they have a live webcam feed at <a href="mms://204.251.3.10:3349" title="mms://204.251.3.10:3349">mms://204.251.3.10:3349</a> which is usually maxed out. There is also a mirror feed at <a href="http://old.mises.org:88/NO2" title="http://old.mises.org:88/NO2">http://old.mises.org:88/NO2</a>. Right now I’m looking a hand holding a clipboard with “Does Papa John’s deliver in New Orleans?” on it. Someone still has his sense of humor.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I’m going to the Red Cross and donating blood. This is worse than 9/11, we all have to step up to the plate.</p>
