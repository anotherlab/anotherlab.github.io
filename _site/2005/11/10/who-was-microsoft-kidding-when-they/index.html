    <p>Who was Microsoft kidding when they promised to end “DLL Hell”? The long dark night of the SQL Server 2005/Visual Studio .NET 2005 beta produced a series of seeming incompatible .NET frameworks. I didn’t do much beta testing with the 2005 bits, but when I did, I did so from the safe confines of various <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> sessions. I’m now looking at some automated build tools and one of our developers suggested MSBuild.

<p>On a slightly separate target, why RSS Bandit is such a resource hog? I loved the interface, but it would bring the performace of my PC to a flying stop. I just started using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/reader/">Omea Reader</a>, and it plays well with others much better than RSS Bandit did.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>….Microsoft promosed that DLL Hell would go away, but with the .NET Framework betas, they dropped us into the biggest DLL Hell I’ve ever seen. I can’t uninstall MSH from my system because I installed the .NET Framework 2.0, which required that I uninstall the beta versions. The MSH uninstaller requires the beta framework, which I uninstalled, so I’m stuck. I can’t install the release version of MSH. This sort of thing is just silly, and <strong>I thought it was a problem that we’d solved</strong>. (To be fair, they did promise that this won’t be a problem for release versions of the framework, but how many millions of times were the betas downloaded?)</p>
