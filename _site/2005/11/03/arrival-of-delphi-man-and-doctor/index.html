It had airmail stamps and came from Middlesex, England. I had no idea what it was, so I ripped it open to find Boland&#8217;s inflatable action figures. The images are courtesy of the crapmatic instant picture device. The top one is Delphi Man, lord of the cubicle. The lower picture is of Doctor Deadline, trusty companion of Delphi Man.&lt;/p&gt; There are limited edition items, Borland only made 1000 of each one. So far they haven&#8217;t turned up on eBay. Oddly enough, the website that advertised the super duo, www.delphisuperhero.com has been replaced with the Delphi 2006 web site. In addtion to registering to win the inflatable characters, there were PDF files that you could download and print your own.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;" />
