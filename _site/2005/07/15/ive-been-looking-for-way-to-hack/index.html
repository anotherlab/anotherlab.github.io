    <p><a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth">Google Earth</a> is cool. They took an excellent product called Keyhole and bought the company last year. The first resulsts of that were the satelite image detail available in Google Maps. Then they recently release Google Earth in three versions, two paid, one free.

<p>I created a DVD last year from the video I shot in China when we brought Laura home and I want to update that video with our flight plan. The current version of the video uses some static maps with flight paths drawn on them, very low tech. It would be really cool to use Google Earth to generate the video of the flight path, but you need the commerical version ($400 a year) to export video. I figured it was a matter of time before someone would hack a way around this. And sure enough, someone (<a href="http://www.gemcor.com/media/randomaccess/C1018474727/E20050714110320/index.html" title="random access...">David Scotch</a>) <a href="http://www.gemcor.com/media/randomaccess/C1018474727/E20050714110320/index.html" title="How to make Google Earth Movies, for Free!">did</a>.</p>

<p>It appears to be pretty straight forward, but I haven’t tried it yet. You need to install a program that can save the video in memory to a file. In David’s blog article, he used <a href="http://www.fraps.com/" title="FRAPS - Real-time video capture &amp; benchmarking">FRAPS</a>. The free version of Fraps will watermark the image, but it should be a good test to see if it works. He then used <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/" title="VirtualDub is a video capture/processing utility for 32-bit Windows platforms (95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP), licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).">VirtualDub</a> to edit the video and reduce the size.</p>
