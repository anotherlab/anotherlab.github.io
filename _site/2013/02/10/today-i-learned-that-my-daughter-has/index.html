    <p>I was watching my 10 year old daughter work on a story in MS Word 2007. To save the document, she was going into the Word menu to select save. I asked her why she just didn’t click the save button. She said “What save button?”. I pointed out the save button that is just above the Home tab.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/-MWkg7SGokI8/URczNEgld5I/AAAAAAAAAC8/GPlXZBcy2KI/s1600-h/Word%2525202007%252520Save%25255B2%25255D.png"><img loading="lazy" title="Word 2007 Save" border="0" alt="Word 2007 Save" src="https://i2.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/-cwUU_pp__4o/URczNWSTwcI/AAAAAAAAADE/jGomxp3e-ho/Word%2525202007%252520Save_thumb.png?resize=244%2C103" width="244" height="103" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>She thought that was the print button. She had no idea that the save button glyph represented a 3.5” disk. She’s never seen one. I have some around, but it’s been years since I have actually used one of those guys.</p>

<p>I dug out an old 3.5 disk and gave it to my daughter. She had no idea what is was.  And was not impressed when I explained to her what it was.</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/-vd86U1-MMR4/URczNwRU4fI/AAAAAAAAADM/G7wjNz3NwIA/s1600-h/blue%252520floppy%25255B4%25255D.png"><img loading="lazy" title="blue floppy" border="0" alt="blue floppy" align="left" src="https://i0.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/-eLwjlwSmqV0/URczOXTbrSI/AAAAAAAAADU/Jkg0Yt62DF8/blue%252520floppy_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?resize=84%2C86" width="84" height="86" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The 3.5” disk had a good run, but it’s been 15 years since Apple came out with the first iMac without a floppy drive. It took a few years for the rest of the industry to catch up, but now the 3.5” disk is deader than a dot matrix printer. Which is another piece of computer technology that my daughter has never seen. </p>

<p>For the last 20+ years, it has been common place to use a disk icon for the save button on toolbars and menus. I don’t think twice about it being obsolete technology, I just “know” that a disk image on a button means save. But for a 10 year old, she doesn’t have that frame of reference to identify the functio.  From her viewpoint, the closest match is a printer, their icons can look a bit like the disk icon.</p>

<p>The problem is that we really don’t have anything now to replace that image. What other object represents saving a file, and can be drawn in a 16×16 matrix? We’ll be carrying around that image for years after the last disk falls part. </p>

<p>We carry around other baggage like that. It’s like dialing up someone on your cell phone. I can’t remember the last time I used a phone that had a dial on it. But the terminology is so well established, we just associate dialing with the act of placing a call.  It’s time to come up with some new visual metaphors.</p>
