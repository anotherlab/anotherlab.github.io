    <p>After demoing some voice dictation with an iPad app that I am working, the microphone button stopped working.  It was fine for one demo, disabled for the next one.  I could not figure out what had changed.  I kept seeing numerous references for <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5176">setting the dictation option</a> and making sure that the iPad had a network connection.  Stuff like this <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4287366?tstart=0">forum posting</a> on discussions.apple.com:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be in Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Dictation, and will only then appear on the keyboard (to the left of the spacebar) if you are onlines – is that where you are looking in Settings ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a good WiFi connection and I didn’t have a Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Dictation option.  I tried rebooting the iPad, no change.  The strange thing was that it working at 2pm and not at 5pm and no changes had been made to the iPad.  We have a pool of iPads that we sign out for testing, this one is the 3rd generation iPad and I have removed all of the apps that other people had installed.  The iPad has iOS 6.1.2 installed.</p>

<p>I saw the Bluetooth icon on the status bar.  It was not lit up, so it wasn’t connected to any devices.  So I went into the Bluetooth settings and saw this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/lh6.ggpht.com/-yy35MSx5tVs/UUaEDOf_SoI/AAAAAAAAAEI/va-9jR_BD7w/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="https://i2.wp.com/lh4.ggpht.com/-wxyK8dxlXl0/UUaEDTQUEpI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/eDu2dv0iCWM/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?resize=644%2C484" width="644" height="484" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>I don’t have ZAGG Keyboard, but someone else must have paired this iPad to one.  In between the demos, I had borrowed another iPad that was in a ZAGG keyboard case.  It must have been in close enough proximity to the one that I was using so that my iPad picked up the other keyboard.  I turned off Bluetooth and the microphone button was back on the iPad keyboard.</p>

<p>That makes no sense.  The iPad was not connected to the ZAGG Keyboard, but it still disabled the microphone button on the onscreen keyboard.  I could not reproduce this with another iPad running iOS5 and a Logitech keyboard.  The microphone button stayed enabled with the keyboard on and off.  One thing comes to mind.  Apple and the keyboard manufactures need to come up with a keyboard button definition for the microphone.  If you are using an external keyboard, it’s annoying to have to bring up the onscreen keyboard to voice dictation.</p>
