    <p>Do you think that hand tweaked C code runs circles around managed code (C#, Java, VB.NET)?  Or do you think that your Just In Time compiled managed code gets the job done more securely than those bit sniffing dinosaurs?  Anxious to prove that Delphi is still relevant?  Want to win some cutting edge component libraries from <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/">DevExpress</a>?</p>

<p>If you answered “yes” to any of those questions, there is still time to enter the <a href="http://www.darwinraceoflanguages.com/">Darwin Race of Languages</a>.  The brainchild of <a href="http://www.sevensteps.com/">Sevensteps</a> CTO <a href="http://blogs.sevensteps.com/">Bart Roozendaal</a>, the Darwin Race is pitting a slate of challengers using the compiler and IDE of their choice to write a utility that will solve one of three problems.  The projects are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Temperatures and CPU load</strong><br />
A utility that will measure CPU temperatures and CPU load on remote computers</li>
  <li><strong>Multi clipboard utility</strong><br />
The utility should hold several entries that were place on the clipboard earlier. In effect it should replace the clipboard.</li>
  <li><strong>GUI to a command line program</strong><br />
A GUI front end for the gbak database command line driven program for the Firebird database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each entry will be <a href="http://www.darwinraceoflanguages.com/html/topic_5F6068C9-41C3-4340-B720-185F11EEA010_405D4AFF-838A-46BD-A0AA-1B573789487A_3.htm">judged</a> on the software itself and how you documented the design and development of the application.  The goal is not to see which development is best tool, but to see what tools are the best for different types of jobs.  To see where the strengths are and where are the weaknesses of each tool, using real world types of the problems.  The documentation part will share the development process and show how different people come up with solutions for similar problems.</p>

<p>There are already <a href="http://www.darwinraceoflanguages.com/html/topic_22E00D06-54FA-440D-A8A1-6CD1130C9F8D_25E832BF-BCF6-4474-92E1-2366CA3A7AE4_1.htm">a bunch of sponsors</a> lined up.  DevExpress will be giving away a a license for <a title="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/DXperience/editionEnt.xml" href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/DXperience/editionEnt.xml" target="_blank">DXperience Enterprise</a> or the <a title="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/VCL/Subscription/" href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/VCL/Subscription/" target="_blank">VCL Subscription</a>.  If you wint, you get to pick one of them.  I have DXperience and most of the VCL components, you can’t go wrong with either one of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The race is <a href="http://blogs.sevensteps.com/2008/07/darwin-race-of-languages-is-on.html">on</a> already, but there is still time to join.  There are a bunch of <a href="http://www.darwinraceoflanguages.com/html/topic_F4FB6FB5-E00D-4A2E-9EC9-1566CEA095D4_1269764A-614D-42AE-9990-4EB1244814CA_1.htm">participants already signed up</a>, covering C#, Delphi, VB, and something on the Mac platform.  Java is not yet represented, does someone out there want to pick up the Java gauntlet?</p>
