    <p>David Byrne and Brian Eno have a new album out, “Everything That Happens Will Happen Today”.  It’s available exclusively through their web site, <a href="http://www.everythingthathappens.com/">http://www.everythingthathappens.com/</a>.  You can listen to the entire album on their site, or by using their streaming player right below this text.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>I’ve been listening to it while writing this post and it’s pretty good. It’s a nice mix of Eno’s music and Byrne’s lyrics and singing.</p>

<p>You can order the album from their website in various formats. They have 320kbps MP3 and FLAC, without any DRM. for $8.99. Yu can also get it as a CD plus the downloadable versions for $11.99. There is a deluxe package for $69.99 with all sorts of stuff for the diehard Byrne and Eno fans. It’s cool that they are selling it themselves. If they sold it through a record label on iTunes, they would get a tiny fraction of the $0.99 a song that iTunes charges.</p>

<p>This is their first collaboration since 1978’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLife-Bush-Ghosts-Brian-Eno%2Fdp%2FB000E5N634%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dmusic%26qid%3D1220735372%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=christmillers-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a><img loading="lazy" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=christmillers-20&#038;l=ur2&#038;o=1" width="1" border="0" />.</p>
