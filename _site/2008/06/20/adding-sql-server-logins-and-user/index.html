          This script starts off in the master database and will require admin access rights to the server.  If we break down the script, we can review what each section does and why it’s doing it
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Lines 4-5 will create the login if it does not already exist.  The Check_Expiration option is set to “OFF” to verify that password expiration policy will not be applied to this login account.  The BOL for SQL Server 2005 states that <a title="CREATE LOGIN (Transact-SQL)" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189751.aspx">this option defaults to “OFF”</a>, but I like to explicitly set that option for a couple of reasons.  One reason is that it stands out when you read the script.  Another reason would be that a future service pack or later version of SQL Server could default that setting to on.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Lines 9-12 create a cursor that provides a list of databases.  We skip over the system tables to save some processing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Lines 17-22, 37-42 handle the mechanics of opening up the cursor and iterating through each row in the set of database names.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Lines 26-27 create a dynamic SQL statement that performs the following steps and then executes that statement:
        </p>

          &lt;/p&gt;

          <li>
            Uses the information_schema.tables view to use this database only if contains two tables that are known to exist in my application database.  This will prevent the user from being added to the wrong database.
          </li>
          <li>
            If this user has a schema, drop the schema.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drop the user from the database.

                      We do give our customers the ability to run with just Windows Authentication, but configuring services to run under domain accounts is an additional set of steps that most of our customers prefer not to use.  It’s a much simpler <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-Of-Box_Experience">OOBE</a> if the services use SQL Server authentication.
