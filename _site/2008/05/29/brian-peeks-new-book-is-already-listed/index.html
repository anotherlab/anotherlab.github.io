    <p>Brian Peek (probably the most well known member of our <a href="http://tvug.net/">TVUG</a> user group) has a book coming out, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596520743">10 Coding4Fun Projects with .NET for Programmers, Hobbyists, and Game Developers”</a>, and it’s listed on Amazon for pre-orders.  Brian is probably best known for his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/03/14/1879033.aspx">managed code API</a> for working with the Nintendo Wiimote.  You can get the current version of the code from it’s CodePlex <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WiimoteLib">page</a>.  His <a href="http://www.brianpeek.com/blog/">blog</a> is worth reading if you want to control hardware devices with .NET.</p>

<p>Not too long ago Brian demonstrated his code at a <a href="http://tvug.net/Events/tabid/56/Default.aspx?PageContentID=46" title="Interfacing External Hardware Using Managed Code">TVUG meeting</a>.  He used the Wiimote to control a radio controlled car.  It was pretty cool watching the car turn when he rotated the Wiimote.  You can download the code from his presentation from his blog at this <a href="http://www.brianpeek.com/files/folders/2008/default.aspx">page</a>.  Other people have used his library to do some interesting <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/">things</a>.  It sounds like this book would be a cool Christmas gift.</p>
