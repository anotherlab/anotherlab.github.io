  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently upgraded my home network with a new router.  I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series">Linksys WRT54GS</a> router, running a custom firmware called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd-wrt">DD-WRT</a>.  DD-WRT provides a lot of extra functionality that wasn’t available with the stock firmware.  It’s the closest thing to a free lunch that you can get, computer-wise.</p>

<p>I’ve had the WRT54GS for a couple of years and it was starting to show it’s age.  I needed to reboot it about once a week or so, or I would lose network connections.  It also predated the 802.11n protocol, and my iPad and one of my laptops support N.  I also wanted a router that supported gigabit speed LAN ports.  So I’ve been in the market for a while now.</p>

<p>Last year, Netgear released a few new N ready routers.  The <a href="http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/work-and-play/WNR3500L.aspx">WNR3700L</a> was designed to be used with custom firmwares.  Netgear even created a website, <a href="http://www.myopenrouter.com/">MyOpenRouter</a>, to support the enthusiasts.  It has a fast processor (480mfz), gigabit ports, and supported G &amp; N on the 2.4ghz band.  I came <a href="http://outfitnm.com/Images/this_close_man.jpg">this close</a> to buying one.</p>

<p>Then I read up on the next size up router from Netgear, the <a href="http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/high-performance/WNDR3700.aspx">WNDR3700</a>.  This is a dual band router.  You can configure B/G/N on the 2.4ghz band, and A/N on the 5 ghz band. You can keep the N devices at the less crowded 5ghz, and leave the G devices at 2.4ghz,  It also has a faster (680mhz) processor.  This router was listed as a <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Netgear_WNDR3700">powerful router on the DD-WRT site</a>.  So I spent the extra money and bought that one instead.</p>

<p>The first thing I learned was that I bought a WNDR3700v2, the 2nd generation model.  DD-WRT was not supported for this model.  It turns out that Netgear based their firmware on the <a href="http://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> project, so out of the box it came with nearly every feature that I wanted.  It had support for updating my <a href="http://www.dyndns.com/">DynDNS</a> account, static IP addresses, IPv6, guest networks, a shared USB drive, <a href="http://www.dlna.org/home">DLNA</a>, etc.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have everything that DD-WRT has.  It doesn’t have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN server</a>.  With DD-WRT, you can run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol">PPTP</a> and <a href="http://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> servers.  I use PPTP for a few reasons.  The main one was to be able to get a secure connection to my home network so that I could open a remote desktop session to my home PC.  I could also use the VPN connection to access sites that would be normally blocked by the network that I was connected to.  The WiFi network at my local car dealer blocks all of the social networking sites.  When I’m waiting for my car, I would open a VPN connection so that I could check Facebook and Youtube.</p>

<p>Using a VPN also provides a level of security when you are on an unsecured WiFi network.  By encrypting your traffic, your are less likely to have someone capture your data.  The <a href="http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/protocol-security.phtml">pptp protocol is not completely secure</a>, OpenVPN has better security.  Apple, in it’s infinite wisdom, <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1607496&amp;tstart=0">does not provide OpenVPN support on iOS</a>.  I could open a PPTP VPN connection from my iPad, but there’s no way to get OpenVPN to work. Well, there is a <a href="http://www.guizmovpn.com/">3rd party OpenVPN client</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking">jailbroken</a> devices, but I’m not going down that route.  At any rate, PPTP is still more secure than unencrypted traffic.</p>

<p>So the WNDR3700 was pretty close to being good enough with the OEM firmware.  Since the WRT54GS was running a PPTP server just fine, I decided to keep it around and use it just as an access point.  That’s part of the joy of DD-WRT, it’s vary easy to customize a router for special needs.  On the DD-WRT site, there are <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_Access_Point">pretty clear instructions for turning a router into wireless access point</a>.  This is all I needed to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change the IP address of the old router.  Since the WRT54GS would be wired to the WNDR3700, they couldn’t have the same IP address.  I changed the WRT54GS from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.2.</li>
  <li>Configured the DHCP server on WNDR3700 to use the range 192.168.1.5 to 192.168.1.254 for handing out IP addresses.  This would make sure that nothing else would get the 192.168.1.2 address.</li>
  <li>On the WRT54GS, set the WAN type to disabled and disabled the DHCP and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq">DNSmasq</a> services.</li>
  <li>Set the WAN port on the WRT54GS to be a LAN port.</li>
  <li>Configured the WNDR3700 to forward the PPTP port, 1723, to the IP address now reserved to the WRT54GS.  Any request for a PPTP connection from the outside would now get redirected from the WNDR3700 to the WRT54GS.</li>
</ol>

<p>After making those changes, I wired the routers together,  I opened a VPN connection to my office PC and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Remote-Desktop-Connection-frequently-asked-questions">RDP</a>’ed into it.  From my office PC, I opened a VPN connection to my home network to verify that the PPTP server was accessible,  It worked the first time.  That’s rare for me, but <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/imaginationstation/detroit-needs-a-statue-of-robocop">I’ll take that for a dollar</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been using this router for a week and it has been rock solid.  There are a few quirks, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">UPnP</a> had some issues with Windows Home Server, but that was easy to work around. The wireless range is much better than what I had with the Linksys.  I probably would have been good with the single band WNR3700L, but I am happy with it’s dual band big brother.</p>
